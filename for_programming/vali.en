However this would potentially cut off valid claims from being filed as employees or consumers of services may not be aware that the business was being sold .
The Panel believes employees or consumers of services should be able to file a claim within a specified period of time after the transfer of the business .
This period should be long enough to ensure that they will learn of the transfer .
Three to six months should be long enough for this purpose .
In any event a purchasing employer will likely have a good idea of the state of the workplace before purchasing .
Employers who have to carry out workplace reviews for barriers to the employment of the four employment equity groups under the Employment Equity Act will have that information available .
Grievances filed under anti discrimination provisions of collective agreements will also be an indicator of the health of the workplace .
In addition a purchaser of a business can include provisions in the transfer agreement to allow it to seek reimbursement from the seller in the event of a human rights claim .
A claimant on the other hand does not have that power .
Other complaints filed with the Commission earlier may indicate patterns of workplace discrimination issues .
