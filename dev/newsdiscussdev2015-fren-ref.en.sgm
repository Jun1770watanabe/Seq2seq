<seg id="1">Sounds like a typical rugby club to me.</seg>
<seg id="2">At an English university, perhaps...</seg>
<seg id="3">Not like any rugby club I know about in NZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">It doesn't make it all right though, does it?</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course it's not right, but the original premise that this is rife in rugby is just pertinent bollix...</seg>
<seg id="6">Well we don't interrupt Muslim prayers or break people's noses in drinking games (well, unless that's part of the game), but we have been known to black up for fancy dress parties.</seg>
<seg id="7">Never played a Nazi themed drinking game though.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yeeha and Ride the Bus are good enough.</seg>
<seg id="9">I made a similar comment on the previous article as the language and sentiment in the fresher's leaflet seemed fairly typical to me.</seg>
<seg id="10">However this new information makes it clear to me that they are going beyond the usual misogynistic banter and drunken pranks often associated with university rugby teams.</seg>
<seg id="11">The incident with the Muslim students especially shows they must just be trying to cause as much offence as they possibly can.</seg>
<seg id="12">You clearly know nothing what so ever about rugby clubs.</seg>
<seg id="13">But hey, why let your prejudice and stereotyping get in the way of facts?</seg>
<seg id="14">I would imagine that LSE rugby team is populated by ex-students of those schools that have a tradition of competive rugby union.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words ex-public school boys.</seg>
<seg id="16">Very different backgrounds to those found within the rugby club in NZ, very different attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="17">So 'misogynistic banter' ok then?</seg>
<seg id="18">Sounds like the rugby club when I was at uni, never witnessed any racist behaviour, but the naked runs through campus, theft, property damag and misogyny were all par for the course from what I personally witnessed during my years living on campus.</seg>
<seg id="19">Absolutely not.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sorry I didn't make that clear in my last comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">You could look at it in a different way: tell yourself that your body itself is made up, in part, of this ancestral water.</seg>
<seg id="2">I am going to become more tranquil.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ancestral as well, therefore, this interstellar cloud (phew, not traditional :))</seg>
<seg id="4">@lux you haven't read the article: less than half of the water in your pastis is older than 4.6 billions years...</seg>
<seg id="5">Yes, well, that means that we could even say that all the water in pastis is, on average, older than 2.3 billion years of age, which isn't quite as bad as that</seg>
<seg id="6">A brilliant middle finger to the believers of the doom and gloom, believers of all kinds who foresaw the end of the oceans and water suppliers, even though this water has always been there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Irrefutable proof that global warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable works of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).</seg>
<seg id="8">@manon troppo: Where is the proof that global warming has stopped?</seg>
<seg id="9">I do not see the link.</seg>
<seg id="10">I think that the comment made by Manon Troppo is supposed to be ironic.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hem, and as for the off-beat humor and irony: what makes you think that?</seg>
<seg id="12">So, you don't understand a lot about ecological problems.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is not a matter for the "believers of doom and gloom", as you say, of worrying about the disappearance of our oceans, but rather, of worrying about the reduction of the water supply that is fit for human consumption (you know, the fresh water that makes up less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).</seg>
<seg id="14">And then, more generally speaking, it is not global warming that is the most threatening thing for our species, but rather the reduction in the resources that are not very, or not at all, renewable (gas, oil, rare earth metals) and that support our way of life, which is becoming more and more greedy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of course, we can doubt the truth of the conclusion made in the study you quoted for which you have generously tried very hard to provide references.</seg>
<seg id="16">With regard to the problems of fresh water, I would like to reassure you that the French are far from being involved :). What's more, we have to stop looking at ecology as if it were a flawless dogma; the hole in the ozone layer is slowly closing (estimated to be at 100% by 2050 at its current speed).</seg>
<seg id="17">Ecology, yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"What's more, we have to stop looking at ecology as if it were a flawless dogma; the hole in the ozone layer is slowing closing" yes, well, it is not as if it were a spontaneous movement that came from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="19">@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2, our planet will end up like Venus.</seg>
<seg id="20">A greenhouse, which, due to the action of oxygen, is going to trap heat and not let it go, and which, as part of a vicious circle, is going to accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anybody seen direct action yet?</seg>
<seg id="2">Any sign of 10,000 boots on the ground planting trees and doing whatever the F a green army does?</seg>
<seg id="3">I certainly haven't.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maybe in Abbott's tiny brain, sending the RAAF to the mideast is his version of direct action.</seg>
<seg id="5">We most certainly are going backwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">When will they dump this village idiot?</seg>
<seg id="7">Well the latest finding that vegetation consumes a whopping 16% more CO2 than any of the climate models allowed for puts re-vegetation as a priority.</seg>
<seg id="8">Makes sense, doesn't it, because CO2 is nature's most abundant plant food, and necessary to sustain flora globally.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seems this bit of science was never 'settled'</seg>
<seg id="10">Seen the green army anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="11">Do nothing government.</seg>
<seg id="12">CO2 Levels rise from 280ppm to 400ppm and the rate is increasing , your argument about plant food is nothing but a bogus distraction.</seg>
<seg id="13">And before you throw the cup at the wall Dooms, the most abundant plant food is not CO2 but nitrogen and the sulphurs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most abundant biologically generated material may be carbon but that doesn't equate to CO2 being the most abundant plant food, so Silverhead's argument is fallacious and deserving of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="15">Direct Action is a joke because nothing more will happen than was already happening.</seg>
<seg id="16">LandCare's budget has been slashed and that money is now being spent on the Green Army.</seg>
<seg id="17">The rub is that instead of the money being spent where it did the most good it is now being spent where it will get the most publicity for the Liberals to shore up their vote in marginal electorates.</seg>
<seg id="18">Your contribution however is a winner in ignorance, well done champ</seg>
<seg id="19">SilverHead, when there's too much C02 in the air, plants photosynthesise less and contain fewer nutrients.</seg>
<seg id="20">This means that animals and people have to eat much more of them to get nutritional benefit.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fact that this deputy is childish is proof.</seg>
<seg id="2">Until now, he has not shown any certificates of his academic rigidity that would stop him from straying away from the rules of the XVII century.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nevertheless, punishing him, and not Th√©venoud, for this is something that a lot of people cannot understand, even if the rules of procedure of the National Assembly are not a tax treaty.</seg>
<seg id="4">This woman cannot be given all the credit for dealing with all of this; more than anything else it comes across as being hysteric.</seg>
<seg id="5">If Mitterrand had find all of those who had made a decision on Mitran...</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember that during the debate on the feminization of nouns the "Academy" was offended: "are we going to say the Keeprice or the Keepess of the Seals" (a position that, until then, had never been occupied by a woman).</seg>
<seg id="7">Pure male chauvinism!</seg>
<seg id="8">"The political arena".... !</seg>
<seg id="9">The sandpit, the backyard of the Republic is round, the backwater of operatic ranting, illusion table etc...</seg>
<seg id="10">But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, whether you like it or not.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the male chauvinist UMP party run independently and insist on the parliamentary rules and regulations whilst, at the same time, throwing the most basic of manners out of the window under false pretenses of them being good manners, the inevitable consequences of their partisan stubbornness and misuse of the political arena should be borne by them "ex officio".</seg>
<seg id="12">The behavior of this deputy is neither normal nor appropriate for his position.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is provoking people so that he is talked about.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until now, he was unknown. Now, he can boast about being known, and for being know as a bum from the primary class.</seg>
<seg id="15">The academy is taking the blame and we are seeing that the deputies are sensitive towards their pockets...</seg>
<seg id="16">The UMP will have to crack down and sort out its internal problems and stop making mistakes and getting involved in scandals.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Academy is taking the blame, especially when we are saying they said something they didn't say.</seg>
<seg id="18">This deputy is behaving like a school kid who is going through a teenage crisis, who is causing a stir and whose mates are going, as a delegation, to see the principal to have their detentions canceled.</seg>
<seg id="19">and defending them based on a text that they have not even read!</seg>
<seg id="20">Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this UMP deputy forum.</seg>

<seg id="1">I call on two expert witnesses, spaced several thousand years apart, M'lud.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is why I love to spend time with animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">The joy they have in play is so obvious and appealing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dogs, dolphins, otters, horses, all of them do silly stuff for the sheer joy of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">By contrast we seem to spend most of our 80 years working, commuting and dragging around the shops.</seg>
<seg id="6">What a weird state we've reached - we have the ability to extend life to twice its original span, but spend most of it in boredom.</seg>
<seg id="7">What happened?</seg>
<seg id="8">Anthropomorphic fallacy I'm afraid.</seg>
<seg id="9">Play is metacommunication.</seg>
<seg id="10">Try harder.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's still a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="12">By the way 'communication' necessarily involves a shared symbol system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Difficult concept for you perhaps?</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess that the concept of interspecies communication is not compatible with your beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Well, yeah.</seg>
<seg id="16">I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate with a dog that I'd like to play - basic body language.</seg>
<seg id="17">After that there is a variety that indicate whether the play is to be a chase, a run and fetch game etc.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism - though I agree with the idea that there's a lot of crap about 'play' with animals when they are actually in communication.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe play is not just 'useful' (it may be, it may be not) it is just something that exists in and for itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">For instance, David Graeber argues 'there is a play principle at the basis of all physical reality'.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thank hope for giving you the opportunity to live, for being in good health and for being able to reply to an article today when, barely 15 years ago, you had to read information without the option to reply.</seg>
<seg id="3">In general, I am not against the ideas and would even tend to be somewhat filled with enthusiasm by those who appear to be crazy at first.</seg>

<seg id="1">The thing is, the demonstration for everyone is just a Catholic and Muslim movement.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yes, that's it: a kind of gathering of homophobes.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it isn't just that.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are also some atheists and humanitarians who do not want modern ways of "producing children".</seg>
<seg id="5">A child does not have to be brought up in a battery cages or produced by technological equipment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Battery cages?</seg>
<seg id="7">Where did you get that from.</seg>
<seg id="8">And if you contest all technical intervention within "production", you have to call for the ban of ART for heterosexual couples, that would only make it consistent.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am particularly surprised that the demonstration that claims to be "for everyone" still does not have that logical statement on its attractive catalog.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that it is not only Catholics that are demonstrating: other religions are as well: Jews, Muslims and Protestants.</seg>
<seg id="11">That said, it is still useful to remember that other churches have ALWAYS been opposed to any progress within society: in 1865 (and I agree with G.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup, violently rose up against the will of the government to allow girls to attend school for the sole purpose of "protecting one's family".</seg>
<seg id="13">We are still that way.</seg>
<seg id="14">And, more recently, the same trends have been thrown at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family while schools have become mixed.</seg>
<seg id="15">It goes to show that we can give credit to the positions these people have.</seg>
<seg id="16">Don't have to be Catholic to be angry about the commercialization of wombs and children...</seg>
<seg id="17">All of this is nearing the end of decadence for Western civilization, which is contested more and more by other!</seg>
<seg id="18">For me, liberty stops at that of another: yes, homosexual couples should be recognized, they have the right to love each other just as much as others do.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it is not a question of tolerating children being a piece of furniture.</seg>
<seg id="20">And that is also valid for heteros who are looking for surrogacy.</seg>

<seg id="2">If he could control a ball better and avoid moments of blistering stupidity, he might have been a more popular player.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, I feel as if any striker, aside from Heskey, who plays that many games for England, will amass a respectable number of goals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Imagine how many Peter Crouch would have bagged had he been given more than 42 caps...</seg>
<seg id="5">Can't disagree, categorically at least :) Since this article is about his goal-scoring I won't go into the other things he offers, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't/didn't) but perhaps that could be another reason why he won many more caps than, say, Peter Crouch</seg>
<seg id="6">Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48pm Recommend 119 Its fashionable to diss Rooney at the minute so you can be forgiving for doing so.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its worth considering though that since signing for Manchester City in August 2011, Ag√ºero has 56 goals & 23 assists in 93 games.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the same period, Wayne Rooney has 59 goals and 32 assists in 96 games.</seg>

<seg id="11">I have to question whether you actually watch football if you think that Peter Crouch would A) deserve as many caps as Rooney and B) score as many as Rooney if given those caps.</seg>
<seg id="12">I genuinely don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's abilities as a footballer comes from.</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, the hard part is consistently getting capped for your country for 13 years and counting...</seg>
<seg id="14">You are seriously comparing Wayne Rooney as a footballer- never mind a striker- to Peter Crouch?</seg>
<seg id="15">You are doing that with a straight face?</seg>
<seg id="16">Some people are absolutely deluded.</seg>
<seg id="17">Please bear in mind in terms of the record that also Rooney hasn't always been England's out and out centre forward during his England career.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead, playing as the withdrawn forward, the Beardsley/Sheringham role.</seg>

<seg id="1">Yes, I know the ice caps of Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia, are on solid grounds.</seg>
<seg id="2">On the other hand, I wonder if the aligning of Venus and Mars etc. should be considered as well?</seg>
<seg id="3">In general, you have to look at Earth as being more "tough" or malleable than what we think.</seg>
<seg id="4">Is that so?</seg>
<seg id="5">A bit perplexing.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, Wylie talks of a "rather simple mechanism: with the melting of the ice, which weighs down on the Earth's crust, the pressure placed on the mantel is released, which causes/would cause 1) a boost in the production of magma, and 2) the facilitation of its access to the surface???</seg>
<seg id="7">In any case, whether it is the "boost" or the facilitation of access to the surface, they would be (more or less) localized.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is hard to distinguish the cause from the effect and vice versa. With regard to global warming, I think it would be wise to focus more on the effects it has on our environment, which is already quite complicated.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a very friendly manner, patricedusud, does this volcanism not have an effect on our environment?</seg>
<seg id="10">Is there not an effect on our global warming, whether in the future or passed?</seg>
<seg id="11">Wouldn't it be wise to no longer cause global warming?</seg>
<seg id="12">When complexity is not resolved by simplification, we apply such simplicity and observe what happens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yes, but also, when it is dark, we see less well.</seg>

<seg id="15">Kind regards, CB</seg>
<seg id="16">All too often we ignore the fact that the Earth's crust is floating on magma, and that the single passing of the moon causes this to rise or fall, recorded to be some 30 to 60cm, according to its position in relation to the zenith, in much the same way it does for ocean water.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whatever enables the tectonic plates to move, just like waves, is more or less facilitated by this moving lump, especially given the polar caps are reduced by ice thawing, which in turn causes a shift in the balance of land in relation to the equator, since the volume of land is consistent.</seg>
<seg id="18">I laught at the 'human', who claims to be the supreme being of Nature and its self-proclaimed leading leader, yet who makes a fool of himself due to the stupid actions it inflicts on the very environment that created him, and from which he has separated himself so much, something that has proven harmful to both himself and to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="19">And all of this in order to stay the supreme leader of a nature that surpasses him in the organization of his own viscera, a leader who, thanks to an invention, money, finds all the possible means of dominating his fellow beings, disregarding partnership.</seg>

<seg id="2">Indeed, it is individualist identities that prevail nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="3">So, she needs to be herself, and non-compliant.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, but Descartes is also somewhat individualistic at the moment, and his intellectual inquiry shows that.</seg>
<seg id="5">But at that time, they were the only assumptions around; nowadays, individualism gives structure to all of society, whether educated or not, whether cultured or not, whether rich or poor...</seg>
<seg id="6">We are in the midst of "mass" individualism!!</seg>
<seg id="7">Don't want to keep going on and on, but aren't there some similarities here with the Cartesian approach when analyzing what we come to believe and what we believe ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">More so than rebellion, doubt is productive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many xxx-liberals refer to it and associate themselves with it.</seg>
<seg id="11">His work on psychiatry does have one negative - reform!</seg>
<seg id="12">By making the problem equal to his paranoia, he put a stop to any progress being done and any consideration for the reality of insanity.</seg>
<seg id="13">And brought about the most reducing and reactionary vision: behaviorism.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gauchet was absolutely right on this point, and being anti-conformist means fighting against being brainwashed.</seg>
<seg id="15">We reproach Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of order.</seg>
<seg id="16">Excellent idea!</seg>

<seg id="5">Recruit better and train teachers better; that falls under a qualitative approach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet, the French political class is not familiar with any approach other than the qualitative one.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are 2 possible solutions: the 1st is to choose teachers based on their ability to pass on knowledge => change the recruitment process.</seg>
<seg id="8">What's more, they hate children because they do not understand them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because they don't understand them, they do not know how to act or react to working well => they have been reduced to establishing a relationship based on distrust, which makes everyone suffer for no reason => we need 1 course for all teaching.</seg>
<seg id="10">A job that can be taught, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="11">But, above all else, teaching is an art, a natural disposition and a vocation, rather than being a technique.</seg>
<seg id="12">Working on and with human beings is not the same as manufacturing car parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pedagogy is not the same things as being a math prof!</seg>

<seg id="1">this was my comment on twitter (@priya963) Hear hear - you can't simply 'add in and stir', women need to be integrated into the development process.</seg>
<seg id="2">What I mean by the above is that in many developing countries, existing norms are challenged, such as childcare or social reproductive roles.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to a recognition that women can work in the economic sphere and that is great - this is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it can't simply be done without acknowledging that women then have a double burden, where they are now expected to go to work as well as still comply with their social reproductive role.</seg>
<seg id="5">Not sure abou that sister.</seg>
<seg id="6">Economy or profits do not recognise gender roles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Money talks and if a gender isn't up to it than roll over !</seg>

<seg id="11">If it was criminal offence then companies would listen.</seg>

<seg id="13">Well said sister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Very problematic that there is no mention of unpaid care work in this article.</seg>
<seg id="15">In some countries, the value unpaid care work (which women perform a far disproportionate share of) has to be shown to be equivalent to over 50% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Unpaid care work is chronically under-supported and under-valued (not to mention under-shared by men), but it keeps our whole workforces and societies running.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unpaid care work is also a major reason why many women are unable to seek meaningful 'economic empowerment' outside of the home...</seg>

<seg id="1">On the face of it, this seems like a horribly patronising idea.</seg>
<seg id="2">But, based on the article, it seems that it is both a response to a genuine problem - the emergency dental grants - and quite effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">So it is hard to fault it.</seg>
<seg id="4">And if only 53% of this trial group were brushing their teeth before hand, and 73% after, it is a bit hollow to complain about paternalism.</seg>
<seg id="5">After all, there is no downside to brushing your teeth!</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed - the crux of the complaints seem to be that they are targeted at the unemployed and that is reinforcing a negative stereotype.</seg>
<seg id="7">But if it's actually accurate, that's not really a fair criticism.</seg>
<seg id="8">Belinda Smith, from Canterbury district health board, said the ministry was concerned by the number of emergency dental care grants being given by the Ministry of Social Development‚Äôs Work and Income service to unemployed young adults.</seg>

<seg id="12">If you brush after drinking wine it can damage the precious enamel coating.</seg>
<seg id="13">If your toothbrush is old and wiry it can spike and inflame gums.</seg>
<seg id="14">And I remember a show on the Guiness Book of Records, where somebody attempted to brush their teeth for the longest time and the Guiness officials at the time strongly discouraged it because of the harmful effects of prolonged and frequent toothbrushing.</seg>
<seg id="15">' on the face of it ' - very funny .</seg>
<seg id="16">It sounds like piss poor experimental design to me.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mere act of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of the participants who knew their brushing behaviour was being studied.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's why most studies of behaviour involve such things as double-blinds, control groups, etc.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no way to project those results onto the program itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">Assuming those texts are sent to every young welfare recipient, there are two things that make that different from the experiment: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they are not providing feedback of when they do or do not brush (results easily buggered up by people reporting according to perceived expectations).</seg>

<seg id="8">Hello and thanks for your posts.</seg>
<seg id="9">I seem to recall having read some time ago that the mummy of a black child was discovered in modern day Libya, and that this discovery opened new doors, most notably in terms of geography and time (I think I recall the mummy being more than 1000 years before the first known African mummies).</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you have any information on that?</seg>
<seg id="11">Thanks in advance.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is interfering a bit with the reading.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maybe these are not due to the influences of modern times.</seg>
<seg id="14">Back then, didn't the desert cover a smaller area than it does now?</seg>
<seg id="15">Why not imagine plants, such as cannabis, growing in the area where there is only sand nowadays?</seg>
<seg id="16">We know the song.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it is enough for a European scientist to claim, even without any proof, so that it becomes a scientific truth: the Egyptians, and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today, have never discovered anything, not even in their own countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the song does not tell us who discovered the African discoveries in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is, and always was, "not well known by its precursors".</seg>

<seg id="1">This is an article by free market neo-liberal quacks, which argues against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.</seg>
<seg id="2">I think there are a few others with Ebola that the Spanish government is lying about, in order to not look bad/affect tourism.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presently I would hope tourism is the least of their considerations.</seg>
<seg id="4">But they might be staying silent to prevent complete panic.</seg>
<seg id="5">I would also hope that about tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (ie those in Spain and the UK) tend to put all business interests before people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Give it a break, feel free to call you local MP and complain about a lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whilst I think the government here are a mob of useless, corrupt f*ckers but as Madrid is not a major tourism hotspot I doubt that is their top concern.</seg>
<seg id="8">What are you waiting for?"</seg>
<seg id="9">(with all due respect and sympathy to the nurse and her colleagues), seeing as how tourism is one of the only things keeping millions of people in this country afloat, I'd say that yes, it is important.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they absolutely had to repatriate the missionaries, I don't know why they couldn't have sent them to a remote military airbase and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than, for example, the capital city.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rajoy was on a campaign to dismantle the Spanish Health Service, privatising nationalised hospitals especially in Madrid which is his power base until the Courts intervened.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is just another smooth talking right wing PR man like Cameron and like Cameron I think he is doomed at the next election.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not the done thing here) socially he is far to the right of him and would fit in well with the loony right wing religious nuts in America.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now he is having to praise the very hospitals he was rubbishing to try and achieve his aims of protecting Spanish tourism.</seg>
<seg id="15">I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or other European right-wingers to the Spanish right...</seg>
<seg id="16">They are on a league of their own, trust me.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Spanish government is lying about nearly everything which concerns it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not that anyone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumours.</seg>

<seg id="9">Your reaction is all the more fascinating given your ignorance on the topic of bosses of VBS!</seg>

<seg id="11">Four handwritten amounts were put on my payslip when I was in my adolescence, more than 100 pieces of information now!</seg>
<seg id="12">Here is an example, we could quote many more, which illustrates the constant amount of pressure imposed without consideration for the consequences that suffocate little businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your article would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just to put a twist on the very common argument that is the thickness of the French Labor Code compared to the Swiss one; a serious scholar would have their head buried in the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of the latter could mean that the Swiss laws are more understandable than our own).</seg>
<seg id="15">Comments in the Code, whether labor related or not, are our way of targeting, most notably, the legal system...</seg>

<seg id="1">KARSENTY RESIGNS, this man is not worthy of an elected office, extremists from all political backgrounds (including Zionists) must be moved to the side</seg>
<seg id="2">Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him many convictions, are a disgrace to both Israel and Neuilly council.</seg>
<seg id="3">He does not represent anyone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Philippe Karsenty is leading the fight against truth to the sideline, all by himself.</seg>
<seg id="5">BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER</seg>
<seg id="6">What does Neuilly council intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who hurls abuse at a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for this town-planner to be attacked?</seg>
<seg id="7">Apology for a crime?</seg>
<seg id="8">I cannot find Neuilly on my map?</seg>
<seg id="9">Is it a new administration that has new privileges???</seg>
<seg id="10">This fella needs help, in the same way that Ulcan Chelli does. Both of them are involved in anti-Jewish/anti-Israeli conspiracy theories, the motivations for which are completely identical to those of their most relentless accusers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just as many people believe that "Zionists" (a term which seems to have lost its meaning as it has been abused) have a role in the political decisions that are taken, these two, much the same as the JDL, or even the CRIF, believe that every critique, however mundane, has an antisemitic undertone "which is reminiscent of the darkest hours of our history because the womb from which the vile beast emerged is still fertile, my fair lady, it is as if we have returned to 19th-century Russia! ".</seg>
<seg id="12">It is worth pointing out that the stupid and unbelievable theories by Karsenty on Charles Enderlin's report are still more stupid that those on September 11th.</seg>
<seg id="13">And God knows that the conspiracy theories on September 11th are disgustingly stupid.</seg>
<seg id="14">And this fella has political responsibilities; that is extremely worrying.</seg>
<seg id="15">To clarify my analogy of the conspiracy theory of September 11th, we can talk of cognitive dissonance for understanding how the topic is addressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Completely blinded by a really bizarre truth; having spent a lot of time, and lots of money supporting this, it is unbearable for followers of this theory to detach themselves from it (just as is the case for religious extremists).</seg>
<seg id="17">By following logic and inevitably changing paths for the better, the end justifies the means, even the lying, which is the last straw, but which doesn't seem to disturb the work of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id="18">You advise people to pay attention and not to categorize everyone as being the same, but that is what you are doing with regard to September 11th.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are still loads of questions that have not been answered on this event, and Bush/Cheney/the Saudis/consorts don't seem to be in a rush to answer them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Indeed, there are some very bizarre theories, but the official theory is also bizarre, at least in some respects.</seg>

<seg id="5">Now to just wait for all the people to attack me...</seg>
<seg id="6">Well it's easy to just say stuff, like "excessive alcohol consumption is on the increase", but takes (slightly) more effort to produce actual facts.</seg>

<seg id="11">Surely two standard drinks a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, which the first quote states increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies is more or less safe.</seg>
<seg id="12">Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should put their heads together (maybe over a relaxing drink or two, but definitely not three) and think up a number on which both can agree - whether or not it has any sound grounding.</seg>

<seg id="7">I completely agree with you, but be careful with regard to point 1: it is not F1, but rather the circuit authorities who refused to bring the start forward as not to mess up the slot time for the TV broadcast.</seg>

<seg id="9">I would just like to wish Jules Bianchi a prompt and quick recovery!</seg>
<seg id="10">Brazil 2003, Europe, 2007, the authorities have failed to appear from between the cranes and F1 has had a series of near misses.</seg>
<seg id="11">We knew that this would happen one day, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, has said it for years.</seg>

<seg id="13">I can only say that we invoke the risks of the job otherwise it is just bad luck when we do not avoid the foreseeable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Well, this accident has already happened.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, it has to be said that there was a yellow flag, which doesn't just mean "no overtaking in the section"; the main purpose of it is to signal danger.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is not shameful, it is fortunate for the family who must have been in front of the telly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even with a yellow flag, the drivers are only going to raise their foot.</seg>
<seg id="18">When conditions are uncertain, the bend can be a lot more hazardous on the next lap, and the driver, who thinks he has approached it with enough leeway, can even take it at a "reduced" speed compared to normal.</seg>

<seg id="3">The CBC ran this story this morning before this happened, which makes one wonder what caused the derailment.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's hard to believe there are still jobs in which one is expected to be on call 24 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't think there are injured people since Canada is pretty much empty.</seg>
<seg id="6">There might be some injured animals like bears, racoons, etc.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hope this is tongue in cheek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Parts of Vancouver have some of the highest densities of population in North America and the Greater Toronto Area has at least six million people.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trains don't just derail in rural Saskatchewan, and these type of trains often pass through busy urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost every Canadian town and city has a railway going through it, and trains rumble through many, many times a day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also, because the tracks often follow water in areas where there are lakes, rivers and ocean, they also pass through areas that are densely populated, as people always want to live by water.</seg>
<seg id="12">As well, all train traffic goes through the center of a town / city as that was central to the original construction of the railways here.</seg>
<seg id="13">You may have been trying to be funny, but there is horrific potential for rail disasters across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mansbridge did a story on this last night, truly shocking.</seg>
<seg id="15">Obviously you didn't read the piece about the train derailment and explosion in a Quebec town that killed 47 people?!</seg>
<seg id="16">Actually you are partially correct.</seg>
<seg id="17">The City of Vancouver was a port city long before the railroad as well.</seg>

<seg id="1">This article, as well as many of the comments, skips over the primordial religious question: a religion is revealed truths, and for its followers no other truths exist.</seg>
<seg id="2">That is where the whole problem is, and the exegeses of theologians only reinforce this fact, otherwise what is the point in talking about the sex of angels?</seg>
<seg id="3">"God said: this is good - this is bad" > that is not compatible with democracy; that is what we call a dictatorship (in other words: theocracy).</seg>
<seg id="4">The words of a leader (Muslim country but that is irrelevant): "But without religion, how would you control the people?" .</seg>

<seg id="6">As pointed out below, (Nowak): problem resolved in 1905 after 40 years of fighting between vicars.</seg>
<seg id="7">May you be touched by His Noodely Appendage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre, who in some way tried to found a cult of the Supreme Being.</seg>
<seg id="9">But our oligarchy also has cults: that of the strong Euro (which is rather bleak at the moment) or that of the free market (which is reasonably supported by the State when it needs bailing out) etc.</seg>
<seg id="10">Big ideas that have come from religious uprisings.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yes, but above all, where there is no difference between a clergyman and a non-believer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where rationale is present, the clergyman tags along behind and expresses himself in schism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Religion was born as an idealogical medium of the State, and the gods were used to offer ambition, even if that in itself led to some forms of dispute.</seg>
<seg id="14">Theology, when it is torn between fidelity in the form of a revelation and adaptation to the zeitgeist, is not familiar with the concept of doubt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fanaticism is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".</seg>
<seg id="16">That does not withstand the analysis of the texts that are full of explicit calls for hatred towards the infidel.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is more the moderate religions (and fortunately there are more of them) that "incorrectly read" the texts, and which only hold on to what is revealed about humanism and the common values shared by all of humanity, atheists and divers believers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For me, fanaticism is the foolish and nasty application of passages of sacred texts, which have been taken out of context.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, some verses of the Qur'an, those which call for the "non-believers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" and "Christians" to be killed, are beyond understanding and are therefore unacceptable if you do not read a few verses before or after, which explain that these executions can only be justified in cases where Muslims are being attacked, killed and are in a situation that requires legitimate defense.</seg>

<seg id="1">If it were Sarkozy who had done that, we would have heard the left screaming like mad.</seg>
<seg id="2">But, it is the nice Mr Hollande, a friend of the trade unions and the small people, so we hear a little bit of protest, but only a little bit</seg>
<seg id="3">That is why the business circles sometimes prefer it when a party claiming to be on the left gets into power.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's the bankers who have financed the victory of Obama, and they have not been disappointed with their investments!</seg>
<seg id="5">"The absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)</seg>
<seg id="6">The job center should be generalizing control over the unemployed at the start of 2015?</seg>
<seg id="7">I hope that, while they are at it, the financial department is also going to generalize the absolute control of the idiots commonly known as plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax avoiders, robbing bosses and other crooks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you know how to write a sentence without using the words banksters or plutocrats?</seg>
<seg id="9">You seem to be very faithful to your jargon all the time</seg>
<seg id="10">It's true. When you are classy: you consider the population to be illiterate and toothless</seg>
<seg id="11">Every time there is a new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications which I write to employers, who, more often than not, don't even send confirmation of receipt, not even an automated one.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also the complete absence of a follow-up and support from the job center.</seg>
<seg id="13">To conclude, I will add that the name "socialist" attached to this government appears to me to be an insult to the memory of Jaur√®s or Mend√®s France.</seg>
<seg id="14">Have we read an article from the Canard Enchain√© here?</seg>
<seg id="15">We have learned that an unemployed person can go for several months without hearing from their center, but that he must continue to look for work on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">We have learned that the checks done have made it possible to strike off people who, in more than half of the cases, did not receive unemployment benefits anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">We must, therefore, ask ourselves how these checks can be done on people that we never see.</seg>
<seg id="18">We must ask ourselves what sanctions would come from stopping someone from accessing the job center's services and unemployment benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">And if we can admit that this reform is going to allow us to strike more people off, then we must ask ourselves how that is going to help in terms of recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have learned that an unemployed person can go for several months without hearing from their center, but that he must continue to look for work on his own". Indeed, this is shameful.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's not like Spanish or Italian authorities have done much about racism in football either?</seg>
<seg id="3">Should we kick them out of the EU?</seg>

<seg id="6">The EU is a peace project.</seg>
<seg id="7">It doesn't make economic sense.</seg>

<seg id="19">This is happening all over the place over the last few years, and I am not exaggerating.</seg>
<seg id="20">This from the Guardian a couple of days ago:</seg>
</p>
</doc>
<doc sysid="ref" docid="27-LeMonde" genre="newsdiscuss" origlang="fr">
<p>
<seg id="1">Is that what he would hope to see, little symmetric sentences, the history of maintaining the controversy?</seg>
<seg id="2">Whatever it is, it is a fact that every time something happens for peace, there has been, is and will be people who add fuel to the fire.</seg>
<seg id="3">Decoding would mean saying that Western countries are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that that itself explains why these States have never done anything against the State of Israel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Decoding would mean saying that for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, we must act against the State identifying itself as Israel, which is overarmed, and is an occupying, besieging destroyer, oppressor and colonizer.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine, to the detriment of the Arab population that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, it would have been more reasonable to remove the German inhabitants of Bavaria (those who were guilty of the Holocaust) and replace them with the Jews that survived.</seg>
<seg id="6">That would have been justice, the Germans did not have a claim over anything, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sir, let's take the colonization of the Western Sahara as an example.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's obvious, let Morocco be the colonialist!</seg>
<seg id="9">But, as for Israel, if you want the truth, you need to also look at its history, its allies and the support it had.</seg>
<seg id="10">Colonialism, whichever one that be, has never been altruistic, we agree there.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, stop going out of your way to support the idea that Israel is a colonizer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Gaul was colonized by the Romans, but there is currently no discrimination between the decedents of the Romans, the Gauls or anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Palestine, discrimination exists depending on one's origins.</seg>
<seg id="14">Elsewhere, the State of Israel defines itself as a State for the "Jewish people", of which no non-Jew can be part.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jews, hence the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conclusion: to solve the conflict, we need to move away from Zionism, which causes Jews and non-Jews to be opposed to each other.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Maghreb, certain peoples have even been baptized in the name of their premier status by this life-saving civilization!</seg>
<seg id="18">Two realities that we have to stop ignoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">Firstly, the European Zionist Project (colonize/take over Palestine), which involves getting rid of the Palestinians. It was, therefore, intrinsically an anti-Palestinian project. As such, the solution requires a break away from Zionism.</seg>
<seg id="20">Secondly, Zionism is a political ideology.</seg>

<seg id="1">One vital component of a good education is respect from the students towards their teachers and the educational institution.</seg>
<seg id="2">That works if the parents instill respect in their children.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is easier for the parents to pass this respect on if they themselves also feel respected by the teachers and their children's school.</seg>
<seg id="4">In good establishments, those which encourage their students to grow, parents are thought of as partners, and not as ahem..</seg>
<seg id="5">Who would believe that it is the teacher who should do all of the work (teach, educate, teach respect, limits, how to live together etc.). It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the work.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, without doubt, it is easier to take it out on the school.</seg>
<seg id="7">Relying on parents isn't working.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one has really taken it all upon themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then, action will remain limited.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the other hand, the educational institution could do many things.</seg>
<seg id="11">Operational solutions can be found there.</seg>
<seg id="12">Is it not necessary for the stakeholders (the teachers, line managers and the ministry) to do their part and not to just take the easy way out?</seg>

<seg id="17">To pass on knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if there are to be demands from parents, then it should be that the school assures them of their child's teaching.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brittany Ferries needs a new boat.</seg>
<seg id="2">They will order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and request aid from the State.</seg>
<seg id="3">And, as they know how to lobby, there is no doubt as to what the result will be.</seg>
<seg id="4">Too bad for the jobs in France which the company has nothing to do with. A company that originates from farmers is always ready to split when their corporation makes losses in the market, especially foreign markets...</seg>
<seg id="5">That's precisely right because their lobbying has not worked, only the order has been canceled.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the company had got a deadline extension or developments for MARPOL, there is no doubt that the project would have succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, to know whether it is good or not, and how BF are going to comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "le Monde" looked into this!</seg>
<seg id="8">The company Brittany Ferries is run by Breton farmers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those who burn the tax and social security offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">They want aid from the State.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fact that they will not get it seems quite normal to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, well, given that it is 30% more expensive to use the French flag on a boat than it is for any other civilized flag, yes, it is normal to expect a little bit of help from the State.</seg>
<seg id="13">Or the other option is for us to learn to tolerate the British monopolizing the market.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's the choice.</seg>
<seg id="15">An everlasting problem with the French, who consider their maritime facade to be a destination for tourists and not an area of activity where people who are different from the average Parisian sometimes live.</seg>
<seg id="16">This difference has a daily cost, lack of investments, and short-lived desires.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the reasons why Brittany has to regain its sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Exactly, and then they will create a Breton flag and have their own crew, which is made up solely of Bretons born and bread.</seg>
<seg id="19">With that, it is certain that they are going to reduce costs significantly...</seg>

<seg id="1">Sadly it's what we've come to expect from the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="2">They're always hated all things prog, so it's hardly surprising they've chosen to overlook Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the spirit of 70s Genesis than that of any of the other members of the band.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hackett was to Genesis what Malcolm Young was to AC/DC.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you don't understand how important he was to the sound, you don't really understand their music.</seg>
<seg id="5">To be fair they hardly mentioned gabriels solo work either.</seg>
<seg id="6">I hardly think that the BBC can be accused of "hating all things prog", given that they've just aired a 1¬Ω hour documentary on one of the greatest ever prog bands.</seg>
<seg id="7">I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about Genesis the band, not about the members' solo projects.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for Hackett's solo career being "closer to the spirit of 70s Genesis", I don't agree.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hackett is no more entitled to go on the road, play a load of Genesis songs that he had varying degrees of hand in writing and claim an affinity to Genesis than David Gilmour is entitled to pull together a load of half-finished demos and call them a Pink Floyd album.</seg>
<seg id="10">Oh, wait...</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't think Steve Hackett is asking for more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Banks' first solo album A Curious Feeling is absolutely brilliant, and very much in the spirit of 70s Genesis.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have overlooked Hacketts solo career because it, lets be honest, sucks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yes they are one of the greatest prog bands but would the documentary have been made if they didn't have their poppy commercial success in the 80s?</seg>
<seg id="15">I have yet to see the BBC do a feature length documentary on bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have just as interesting a history but lack the mainstream appeal that Genesis has.</seg>
<seg id="16">Good points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though I'd say the BBC have 'always' hated the fact that they used to LOVE progressive music back in the day.</seg>
<seg id="18">Person with vested interest shouts "bias": of course he does.</seg>

<seg id="1">If the death penalty is an attempt to repeat one horrible act by committing another horrible act (including, sometimes, acts against innocent people), then it is a brilliant success.</seg>
<seg id="2">There will always be a big difference between a criminal who has been sentenced to death and those who kill him.</seg>
<seg id="3">The criminal committed his act because of his misconception of society and its rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Those who kill him do so with the fairest and wisest vision and reflection in society.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is to say, there is no excuse.</seg>
<seg id="6">They cannot be defended.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, we understood your point of view the first time.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.</seg>
<seg id="9">You have to be different from the average person to enjoy violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">That is what the criminal does due to his misconception of things.</seg>
<seg id="11">But that is also the byproduct of pain, hatred and the conviction and punishment from relatives of the innocent victim: a misconception which will never prevail over those who decide, wisely and based on sound and fair reasoning from their pedestal, on the death of another person.</seg>
<seg id="12">But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, we could, all the same, argue that being sentenced to death was, usually, savagely violent, and they enjoyed it, and it was generally given to people who were friendly and who bore the costs of it all for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain fade along with the death of the person who was the killer, sometimes the torturer, of their loved one, and someone who haunts them at night.</seg>
<seg id="14">Let's not undermine their relief.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thanks √âmilio for this thought, I find it very fair.</seg>
<seg id="16">Strong and moving article.</seg>
<seg id="17">With regard to Marc Asnin, he is proof of great intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="18">That of the heart.</seg>

<seg id="1">I would have thought that sorrell might go quite well with kippers! <*))))))<<</seg>
<seg id="2">This is purely about numbers and driving down wages and creating housing problems, I'm sure if I was a second generation immigrant whose life was good because my parents had come here I'd have some reservations about the issue of immigration but it's no reason to oppose controls.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the most sensible people on a reason programme on the bbc about immigration was a second generation Sikh who said she felt comfortable about the numbers of people coming in and the changes they were bringing with them, she was paired up with a muslim man who was very unco-operative, refusing even to ladel out portions of soup simply it was associated with the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship even though she assured him he did not have to pray</seg>
<seg id="4">** 'who said she felt UNcomfortable about'</seg>
<seg id="5">As we all know left unchallenged the UK will continue to go to the right - anyone that draws a line in the sand to challenge this has to be admired even if he is an ad exec :) Good on you!</seg>
<seg id="6">More too the right?</seg>
<seg id="7">Where have you been living?</seg>
<seg id="8">If this Country was anymore left it would be communist.</seg>
<seg id="9">In your view, what did New Labour do that was particularly left wing?</seg>
<seg id="10">The liberalisation of a country, constant NHS this NHS that, mass immigration immigrati( in their words to rub the rights noses in it), benefit culture, the age of self entitlement, political correctness killing freedom of speech.</seg>
<seg id="11">I understand that Labour is centre left and not communist, that was said in jest, my point is that they socially engineered a very large percentage of the population to be dependant on the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Very left wing if you ask me.</seg>
<seg id="13">Spout your prepared lines as much as you want, but what I asked you for were specific examples of left wing policy, or a left wing agenda being pushed by the New Labour government.</seg>
<seg id="14">Can you do that?</seg>
<seg id="15">With respect that is not what you asked, you asked what, in Daniel Johnson's view did New Labour do which was particularly right wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">He told you his view, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you were asking for.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yeah - it's much more Tim Bell's territory.</seg>
<seg id="18">So Martin Sorrell, the UK‚Äôs most powerful advertising executive, conflates the situation of his parents with that of the economic migrants coming to Britain now?</seg>

<seg id="3">We will play happy economics while chucking out these technocrats...</seg>
<seg id="4">Some would say we need to renegotiate the treaties.</seg>
<seg id="5">Agreed, let's renegotiate, and if the word "democracy" still means something in Europe, that is what should happen, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="6">Curiously, the commission isn't addressing the unfair financial competition between countries and companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">That has to be a negotiable amount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...</seg>
<seg id="9">The EU only has one objective, and that is to make the entire railway sector market-orientated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, it means that the whole of France will no longer be served by the railways.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many countries have already fallen victim to such a withdrawal and it will only get worse.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sacrificing everything, including the future of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa, does not seem like a good idea to me.</seg>

<seg id="14">Not at all.</seg>

<seg id="3">It seems to me that you have not really been able to separate out the problems that existed within the marriage and that you are, not unnaturally, still trying to resolve the hurt and anger now it has been over for five years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Obviously, having an alcoholic ex living in such close proximity and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is galling and very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="5">That said, it would seem sensible to me to begin a process of separating out your life from the complications that he has left behind.</seg>
<seg id="6">They seem to be doing this but it seems hostile.</seg>
<seg id="7">As you are all in such close proximity and complications seem likely to continue and new ones arise have you considered a proper time limited 'plan' of 'escape' so you can separate out your own life and future.</seg>
<seg id="8">The financial problems are pernicious but with a sympathetic mortgage company, a good solicitor and some pressure from the Courts they can be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="9">He sounds vindictive and persistent.</seg>
<seg id="10">What about a Family Case Conference to get it all out in the open and some support for him to get him back working and paying maintenance.</seg>

<seg id="12">Your life is so much bigger than the part you shared with your ex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Really good advice.</seg>
<seg id="14">My advice, ask the children what they'd like to do, even if that means meeting the new wife.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tell them that you'll support anything they decide to do.</seg>
<seg id="16">Warn them he may not keep his promises about contact and ask them to consider how they'll feel about that and how they'll best deal with the dissapiontment if he fails to keep his arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Try for their sake to maintain some connection to their father.</seg>
<seg id="18">If they see you're doing this for their benefit, despite your own reasonably held resentment about how he's treated you, then they will respect you.</seg>
<seg id="19">They'll never lose their love for you and if you do everything to facilitate a continuing parent/ child relationship, they will know who to thank when they get older.</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm of the belief that children eventually can see where the faults lie, if they're left to see it for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="9">Typical bad reportage, focus on the "its just a plastic sword" and not the inspirational jihadi text written on the thing.</seg>
<seg id="10">The sword - a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar - is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">I really like the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2">All of these marvelous innovations, often technology related, make many people believe that it is a right or a necessity to take advantage of them, but there is an upfront cost, and worse, a staggered price (subscription, electrical consumption) which takes its toll on budgets.</seg>
<seg id="3">And not being able to take advantage of the new technology leads to frustration.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, making use the Energy Solidarity Pact (Pacte Energie Solidarit√© - PES), which enables you to insulate the attic of your home for ‚Ç¨1 if the house is lived in by a couple on a low income (the cost of the work is in fact paid for by the energy providers!).</seg>
<seg id="5">Simply efficient, but misunderstood, even if more than 3000 houses have been insulated in this way this year!</seg>
<seg id="6">This PES is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="7">But never heard it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">How can you make use of this and how does it work?</seg>
<seg id="9">Information for 60 million consumers, test showers for their water economy and it is advised that faucets and toilets are fitted with water saving gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study found that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) i.e. a saving in water of 50 m3 per year, all with the same amount of comfort.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is no crisis in terms of demand, it is a crisis in terms of the system, which no longer produces enough surplus (it would then have to redistribute by increasing revenue in real terms) so that the surplus pays for the increase in expenses that you categorize as "unavoidable expense".</seg>
<seg id="12">In other words, fuel poverty is "just" the other side of the coin, and the fact that the economy is no longer growing as quickly as they would like.</seg>
<seg id="13">It should be noted that the neo-classical economic theory is completely incapable of answering such a question because, as far as the theory is concerned, there are no intrinsic limits to economic growth, and there is nothing to stop economic growth from getting stronger and stronger, decade after decade.</seg>
<seg id="14">By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows all physical transformations to take place.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the same way that production is fundamentally a form of transformation, energy is what allows the slightest amount of economic output (goods or services).</seg>
<seg id="16">And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.</seg>
<seg id="17">That means that any increased constraint on obtaining energy (incorrectly called energy "production"), even by increasing the cost, is a constraint, in turn, on the level of production (except for improving energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency also requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not that expensive).</seg>
<seg id="18">In short, there is a very strong link between fuel poverty and the fact that we are, or are not, increasing the "production" of cheap energy.</seg>
<seg id="19">And very official public data, for example, from the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in its recent reports, clearly states that in 2008 we reached a peak in the production of conventional oil, meaning cheap oil.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong energy density, the ease with which it can be transported, manipulated and stored, and the range of its possible uses etc.)</seg>

<seg id="5">Nice to see a little justice done to German wines.</seg>
<seg id="6">A rather important point is that German vintners traditionally use only one variety of grape, which means they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, some of the younger generation are now experimenting with several types of grape, along the lines of France, Italy &c.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only the Mosel region is to be recommended - Franconia, the Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden are all well worth a visit.</seg>
<seg id="9">An interesting region in France is Alsace, this being a sort of cross-over between Germany and France.</seg>
<seg id="10">The wines are very much in the German style (or perhaps it is the other way round, whatever).</seg>
<seg id="11">Germans prefer beer.</seg>
<seg id="12">They traditionally drink wine after the meal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Knowing the world's liking for dry whites with the meal, they now offer plenty, with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">But their traditional wines estate-bottled are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.</seg>
<seg id="15">Try Schloss Volrads spatlese with lobster thermidor next time you're round the chippy.</seg>

<seg id="19">I appreciate that there will be new Guardian readers coming to wine anew, but this is a rehash of every single piece about German wines in the paper since the old King died.</seg>
<seg id="20">Every so often there's a piece about how German wines are just about to happen, new Baden drys will now go with food, the reds are surprisingly vigorous, but most of all they're not those nasty liebfraumilchs that people drank in their youth (um, I genuinely don't think that's still true or resonant, unless this is being addressed to the over-40s - whom, as I say, will have seen all this before).</seg>

<seg id="4">The worst fate for a politician at the end of their career: not being recognized on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hello, she was not recognized in her hometown of Toul, which was enough to get rid of her.</seg>
<seg id="6">How exactly is "provincial" a good thing!</seg>
<seg id="7">We live in horrible times, Miss Morano.</seg>
<seg id="8">I am, of course, against the wearing of a burka, but that is not the issue.</seg>
<seg id="9">The message behind this story is Sarkozism through and through: the tiny, modest people having the power of a minister, confusion between the function of government and how it is run (if he could, Sarkozy would come back with his tonfa on every road traffic accident just to show that he is the guardian of public order); rudeness and presumptuousness to the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="10">I suggest we give Morano, Sarkozy and all of these "former personalities", who have become idle, the right to carry a firearm and a badge of honor, so they will have all the time in the world to exercise their self-proclaimed role as upholders of the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">Who is Nadine Romano anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the main lesson learned from this whole thing is: even the police have made a fresh start with Sarkozy, and maybe they will not regret it.</seg>
<seg id="13">He really needs to stop before this gets embarrassing for him.</seg>
<seg id="14">I envy the officer who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...</seg>

<seg id="20">Morano obviously has no regard at all for the police officer stood in front of her, who, without doubt, would have had to grovel to her and be like "yes, Madam; of course, Madam; straight away Madam; tell me Madam, which way do I have to run in order to catch this covered up woman immediately".</seg>

<seg id="2">Americans are not bad at it, but still I think Isis will surpass them or already did, in Iraq someone was at least counting bodies now no one do.</seg>
<seg id="3">When it comes to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing comes close to the west's war machine.</seg>
<seg id="4">I disagree, UN ( includes non westerners) imposed sanctions between both Iraq wars is said to have squeezed the life out of millions of Iraqi's, children and elderly and vulnerable adults especially .</seg>
<seg id="5">Most of the anti- war protestors I knew argued for continuation of sanctions rather than unleashing the 'war machine' .</seg>
<seg id="6">Were you a sanctions preferable to ordinance and boots on the ground kind of guy too?</seg>
<seg id="7">A very good point - the UN has taken some incredibly callous and ill-considered actions over the years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sanctions are generally ineffective and do little to hurt the elites - no doubt a reason why they occasionally get the nod from the so-called Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="9">You might remember the insurgents wasted no time marking their main enemy as they saw it, in the recent Iraq war.</seg>
<seg id="10">That was the attack on the UN Mission HQ they had set up only 5 days earlier in Baghdad 2003.</seg>
<seg id="11">They hit that place hard and twice over and I would imagine with some cold satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="12">As brutal and as callous as that bombing was, I was taken by surprise at how shocked people were that a UN mission was targeted the way it was.</seg>
<seg id="13">Good point, I did forget that.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, add another half a million to the death toll from the western nations (at least with the recent trouble in the Ukraine the economic activity was aimed directly at the people they were intended to hurt).</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only even vaguely reliable figures for sanctions-related deaths are for children under 5, and these are very suspect because Saddam Hussain refused to allow objective inspectors in.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was obviously in his interest to inflate the negative effects of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The most reliable estimates extra deaths for this age group are between 200,000 and 400,000, but nobody really knows.</seg>
<seg id="19">As for extra deaths in other age groups, any estimates are no better than guesses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since pre-sanctions deaths of under-fives were about 10 times worse than the UK, for examploe, it is likely that post-sanctions deaths would be heavily biased towards this age group.</seg>

<seg id="2">We have to stop pretending that people are pure spirits, and that love is the only thing that children need, and that we can have them with people we do not know; someone who neither the parent nor the child is likely ever to know, and with no consequences to them.</seg>
