<seg id="1">It is written in Hitler's Autobiography "Mein Kampf" that the size of the lie is the main reason for trust.</seg>
<seg id="2">People accept the bigger lie more easily than the smaller lie due to the primitive simplicity of their brains.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the emergency Congress leader Devant Baruah used the slogan "Indira is India".</seg>
<seg id="4">But the historical facts are different.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is a glorious history of nation building.</seg>
<seg id="6">The people of India have made the country world renowned with their active efforts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Philosophy and culture, the Vedic sages Kapil, Buddha, Mahavira and Shankara are such notable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dynasties such as Chandragupta Mauraya, Ashoka etc.,are examples of ancient national unity.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a long list of iconic men who fought against foreign armed attacks and rulers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Vivekananda, Dayanand, Tilak, Gandhi, Subhash, Patel, Lohia, Bipin Chandra, Ambedkar etc., and Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad make a long list of immortal martyrs, but Congress has only been giving credit for nation building to the Nehru - Gandhi family.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bigger lie is the more effective.</seg>
<seg id="12">Out of the 58 central schemes 16 have Rajiv Gandhi's name on them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The list of other schemes, awards, airports and institutions with the Nehru family name attached to them is long.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now preparations are being made to name even the Public Distribution System i.e., the PDS scheme, after Indira Gandhi.</seg>
<seg id="15">The names of such iconic men have been inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">Naming streets, universities or airports after them is welcome, but to name the rural housing scheme of the national capital's international airport is not acceptable under any circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="17">The public distribution system has already been brought into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="18">Who is stopping the Congress from asking for votes in the name of this scheme?</seg>
<seg id="19">But what is the problem in looking beyond the Nehru family, when it comes to naming?</seg>
<seg id="20">Many competing arguments were exchanged between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the main opposition party prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, about the greatness of Sardar Patel.</seg>
<seg id="21">Patel is a great nation builder.</seg>
<seg id="22">He joined 562 states into one nation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Patel belongs to everyone, he is loved by the whole of India, but Congress has made him their own property.</seg>
<seg id="24">The public distribution system may be named after Patel too.</seg>
<seg id="25">This will not affect the importance of Patel in any way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Congress has been in power for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="27">The politicisation of the schemes was done by Congress itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">Congress was once a democratic party, with democratic leaders like Tilak, Gokhale, Gandhi, Subhash, Rajendra Prasad, Nehru, Patel and Madan Mohan Malviya. Since 1950, it has come under a single family's control.</seg>
<seg id="29">Party and Family have become synonymous.</seg>
<seg id="30">To proclaim family and country synonymous the slogan 'Indira is India' was created.</seg>
<seg id="31">The naming of the schemes has also become a household matter.</seg>
<seg id="32">Government schemes are run from the accumulated exchequer, from the country's taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="33">The nation's exchequer is not the property of any single family in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="34">Following the example of Congress each party created their own icons.</seg>
<seg id="35">The regional parties ran schemes in the names of politicians as they wish.</seg>
<seg id="36">Everyone has icons, but the list of party icons kept increasing.</seg>
<seg id="37">Currently, every small or large party has its own icon.</seg>
<seg id="38">Government schemes are not run in the names of political leaders in America.</seg>
<seg id="39">Their justification in India is pathetic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The centre plans to take the credit for all the schemes by running the schemes in the names of the Nehru family.</seg>
<seg id="41">Schemes in the names of Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose or Bhagat Singh's cannot be identified with the identity of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="42">Congress has moved away from its heritage.</seg>
<seg id="43">Only preaching or messages from Rahul-Sonia seem to work for Congress.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course the other parties also name their schemes the same way, but they do not stick to one family's name for every scheme.</seg>
<seg id="45">The politicization of social welfare schemes is condemnable.</seg>
<seg id="46">The laptops distributed in Uttar Pradesh have the picture of the SP chief on them.</seg>
<seg id="47">Of course, the voters give the majority winning party the right to make policies.</seg>
<seg id="48">The government is bound to the planning and implementation of their duties, but the taxpayers and voters definitely do not give the government the right to name the schemes as they wish.</seg>
<seg id="49">Voters expect governance from the government not politics, and taxpayers expect the proper transparent use of the exchequer.</seg>
<seg id="50">The misuse of the exchequer is a constitutional offence.</seg>
<seg id="51">Some kind of naming protocol has to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="52">Political leaders are not the solution to everything.</seg>
<seg id="53">India is full of multi-talented geniuses.</seg>
<seg id="54">The names of the institutes of higher education / research institutions must named after talented Indian scientists.</seg>
<seg id="55">A philosopher's name or a distinguished author's name will be appreciated for literature, philosophy or the art institutes.</seg>
<seg id="56">There is a lack of a sense of history in politics.</seg>
<seg id="57">There was also a long debate on naming the country in the constituent assembly.</seg>
<seg id="58">Seth Govinddas, Kamalapati Tripathy put forward 'Bharat'.</seg>
<seg id="59">The name Bharat received 38 votes and India received 51.</seg>
<seg id="60">The fundamental question is: why is no serious thought given to the naming of the schemes?</seg>
<seg id="61">Why is politics always involved in this?</seg>
<seg id="62">Why is such importance given to one single family?</seg>
<seg id="63">Why not make a list of common public approved names?</seg>
<seg id="64">Joint committees of Parliament and the legislature may also be used to create a list.</seg>
<seg id="65">Why is there gross negligence at both the national and state levels in naming the schemes?</seg>
<seg id="66">Due to this negligence, the young generation is forgetting the names of our freedom fighters.</seg>
<seg id="67">There are different types of heroes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Some are created by TV and mostly are biased with political prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="69">Naming is a cognitive exercise.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the "Jnyansukta " of the Rigveda, naming has been called the beginning of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="71">Naming the schemes well can be inspirational.</seg>
<seg id="72">Memorising names of great people from general knowledge books is an act of labour, but naming the government schemes, streets or important places after inspiring personalities is the easiest tool for reviving a the sense of history.</seg>
<seg id="73">Names like Gandhi Nagar, Patel Airport, Ambedkarpuram or Vivekanandapuram add an historicalinspiration.</seg>
<seg id="74">In a recent survey conducted just two to three months ago, it was shown that half of the country's villages and cities are associated with the name of Rama.</seg>
<seg id="75">Extra vigilance is required in naming the country, period, culture, civilisation and history.</seg>
<seg id="76">Their names become representative of specific expressions and approaches.</seg>
<seg id="77">Dayananda, Vivekananda and Gandhi's names are synonyms with social reform, Vedic philosophy truth and non-violence, respectively</seg>
<seg id="78">The Friends of Congress are requested to overcome their addiction of looking for names from the same family.</seg>
<seg id="79">There are many names in Indian history with a golden glow.</seg>
