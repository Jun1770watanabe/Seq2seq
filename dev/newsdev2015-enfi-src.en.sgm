<seg id="1">Changes in business support policies - Region - Areas - News - Karjalainen</seg>
<seg id="2">In addition to EU support for businesses, also the administration of national business support will be concentrated in four Centres for Economic Development, Transport and Environment (ELY Centres), starting from mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ELY Centre of Southern Savo in Mikkeli is responsible for the activity in eastern Finland.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the new business support law, which came into effect in the beginning of July, the EU’s Structural Funds support may not be applied to large companies any more, except in case of completely new activities.</seg>
<seg id="5">The subsidiaries of the municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants will also be considered as large municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the EU support can be granted also in the future for investments that improve municipalities’ economy prerequisites.</seg>
<seg id="7">The unit which will be administrating both EU and national support in eastern Finland will consist of approximately 30 persons.</seg>
<seg id="8">At least for the time being, all of them will continue working at their current sites.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, the workplace of Mr Kalevi Pölönen, the head of the Structural Fund unit of the Southern Savo ELY Centre, is in Joensuu.</seg>

<seg id="1">Researcher: this is what Russia aims at in Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russia acts in a consistent manner, even though it always wouldn’t seem so.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lecturer Torsti Siren, Lieutenant Colonel and the director of the Department of Strategic and Defence Studies of the National Defence University, wasn’t surprised by the ambivalent Ukraine news on Monday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">It has been the same stuff for a long time, Siren says.</seg>
<seg id="5">On one side, we had Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov calling for an immediate ceasefire and declaring that Russia will not attack Ukraine. (Read more here.)</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other side, we had Ukraine reporting that their paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank unit near Luhansk airport, and that the tank unit has received reinforcements. (Read more here.)</seg>
<seg id="7">Lavrov demands an unconditional ceasefire to be achieved at the talks in Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russia denies being involved, and requires that an immediate negotiation outcome must be reached, so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and in Donetsk.</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s the whole point, Siren says.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the big picture: you must start negotiating quickly, and especially so, that Russia will get a hold of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.</seg>

<seg id="2">Finnair will start buying cabin services from a Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation as subcontracted work.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the first phase, the agreement concerns Finnair’s Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but the plan is to extend it later.</seg>
<seg id="4">The outsourcing of the two routes will result in a reduction of approximately hundred employees in Finland, and it will be carried out through lay-offs in the first stage, the company told in its statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, the employment of approximately 80 Asian temporary workers will end when the routes will be outsourced.</seg>
<seg id="6">Finnair told already in June that it is going to outsource the cabin services of approximately 20 routes during the next two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company decided to opt for the outsourcing, after an agreement regarding the savings couldn’t be reached with the personnel.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plan is to start the outsourcing during the first three months of next year.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the company the co-operation negotiations shall continue also with other partner candidates.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study shows that the sleep disorders will multiply the risk of the nerve-originated back pain, i.e. sciatica pain, among the persons performing heavy duty shift work.</seg>
<seg id="2">A study carried out by Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">The connection between the sleep disorders and the sciatica pain is surprisingly strong, even though several other factors were taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="4">Firefighters’ good muscular strength and physical endurance, which are tested regularly, don’t seem to protect from pain, says lecturer Sirpa Lusa, the director of the research, in the statement from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.</seg>
<seg id="5">The firefighters’ work is irregular shift work, and the shifts may be up to 24 hours long.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Finnish Institute Occupational Health, the sleep disorders are common in this type of work.</seg>
<seg id="7">The results are based on a survey, which was carried out in 1996, 1999, and 2009.</seg>

<seg id="1">Are you aware of the new surprising reasons for water damages?</seg>
<seg id="2">Easily cause damage in other apartments</seg>
<seg id="3">Water damages A specialist from the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation reminds that the origin of a water damage is by no means always a leaking tube or a dripping tap.</seg>
<seg id="4">We have been contacted when the breaking up of a fish tank has caused a water damage in the condominium, and we have been asked if it is possible to ban the fish tanks, says Marina Furuhjelm, the law specialist of the Finnish Real Estate Management Federation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms Furuhjelm reminds that the tubes and drains alone aren’t the common causes for water damages, but nowadays also the new appliances, such as ice cube machines, have increasingly been causing water damages in the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many aren’t aware that the appliances, such as dishwasher or laundry machine, must not be left turned on unattended.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also the water tap must always be shut when the appliance is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the tubes may lead to a leak.</seg>
<seg id="8">A dweller can be deemed negligent, if these obligations have been omitted, and in such cases the dweller is liable to pay the damages.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of course, in such cases the home insurance may pay a compensation, depending on the insurance terms and on the case.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dweller is liable to pay the damages, if it can be shown that the dweller’s negligent actions have caused the damages.</seg>
<seg id="11">If the dweller has passed out in the shower covering the shower drain, the negligence can often be proved, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere, and the janitor enters the apartment in which the passed out dweller can be found.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Furuhjelm tells that since the passing out on the shower drains has become so common, nowadays many student dormitories have two floor drains installed in the shower facilities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also waterbeds have caused water damages, albeit not as often as before, when they were more popular.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the tipping over of a dog’s water bowl or of a homemade wine container can result in serious water damages.</seg>
<seg id="15">I also know about a case in which the many cats living in the apartment had been peeing on the floors so, that it caused great damages, says Ms Furuhjelm.</seg>
<seg id="16">The principle of the liability to pay for the damages is always the same, unless the condominium statutes state otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="17">The member is responsible for repairing the surface material and the damages in the condominium structure, as well as the damages caused to other apartments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The water damages easily ruin other apartments, because the structure’s concrete absorbs water very easily.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms Furuhjelm says the heater leaks are especially troublesome, as the heaters easily leak into the structure insidiously.</seg>
<seg id="20">The water damages can be caused by the air source heat pumps, which have become common nowadays, and which produce condensate water.</seg>
<seg id="21">The water should be conducted to a fixed drain or rain water network, and not just into a container.</seg>
<seg id="22">The member also has the responsibility of removing water, ice, and rubbish from the balcony, the law specialist advises.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms Furuhjelm instructs that even if the condominium rules don’t require for example a fixed outlet tube for the washing machine, the insurance terms may have a clause based on which the compensation will not be paid.</seg>
<seg id="24">The home insurance terms and conditions should be read carefully.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, I consider the loose washing machine water outlet tubes, that have been positioned for example in the bathtubs, a great risk, and they have caused several damages.</seg>
<seg id="26">I recommend that the waste water would always be conducted in a fixed way into a sewage pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="27">Removing snow and water from the balcony</seg>
<seg id="28">Monitoring the washing machine, dishwasher, etc. when they are on.</seg>
<seg id="29">Closing the water taps (of the washing machine and the dishwasher)</seg>
<seg id="30">Cleaning of the visible parts of the floor drain twice in six months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommendation is to connect the waste water in a fixed manner into the drain.</seg>
<seg id="32">Checking the taps for possible leaks</seg>
<seg id="33">Regular unfreezing of the freezer</seg>
<seg id="34">Have you experienced water damages?</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Honka lost again and sank to the bottom of the series</seg>
<seg id="2">The two currently weakest teams, according to Veikkausliiga league’s performance barometer, met on Sunday evening in Tapiola Sports Park.</seg>
<seg id="3">FC Honka hasn’t won since June, and was now hosting Vaasan Palloseura, which has been proceeding steadily on a zero win path for seven matches in a row.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last time VPS won, was exactly in a match against Honka in July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sunday’s confrontation with the Espoo team surely happened at the right moment, as VPS returned finally to the win standard with the result 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vaasa’s head coach Olli Huttunen lamented about the inefficiency of his team before the match, but Honka’s disorganized defence department eased VPS’s problems with scoring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In terms of playing, it was a very nervous performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">We didn’t manage to get any longer attacks at all, we couldn’t keep the ball,” Mr. Huttunen assessed the performance of his team.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the first half, the centre-back pair Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a really uncertain manner.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both goals scored by Vaasa’s team were result of the centre-backs’ slack playing.</seg>
<seg id="11">The opening goal of the match was seen after five minutes only, when Steve Morrissey directed a shot from Sebastian Sandvall past Honka’s dumbfounded goalkeeper Walter Viitala.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first half irritates me.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the team went on the field, they did exactly the opposite as to what we had agreed before the game,” Honka’s head coach Shefki Kuqi darned.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the initial shock, Espoo’s players got their playing together, and were then juggling the ball at the offensive end.</seg>
<seg id="15">Especially the midfielder Carlos Portela and the winger Roni Porokara were eagerly searching for scoring opportunities, but the last solutions were nearly repeatedly miserable.</seg>
<seg id="16">The player who got closest to scoring was the midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres eventually gravitated slightly past the VPS’s goal post.</seg>
<seg id="17">VPS stroke back efficiently, taking advantage of their quick forwards and Honka’s bungling centre-back pair.</seg>
<seg id="18">At thirty minutes, Vaasa’s team scored 2-0, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart made a breakaway together.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morrissey served and Steward finished.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the opening period Morrissey was in a good playing mood, and he continuously created occasions from his left wing,</seg>
<seg id="21">whereas Stewart’s speed seemed to be too much for Espoo’s defenders through entire match.</seg>
<seg id="22">”I yelled them at the half-time, that if we’re going to lose, let’s lose with dignity,” Kuqi said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Vexed Honka sought furiously a goal in the second half in order to narrow the result.</seg>
<seg id="24">The team was close to scoring twice, until the third attempt succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="25">The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal from the middle of the penalty area.</seg>
<seg id="26">After Vilaboa’s goal Honka had a half an hour to reach a draw.</seg>
<seg id="27">Espoo’s team took greater and greater risks, which gave VPS opportunities to dangerous counter-attacks.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both Stewart and Morrissey got once in a face-to-face situation with Viitala, but the sharp stopping of Honka’s goalkeeper kept the home team in the game.</seg>
<seg id="29">Towards the end Honka slightly ran out of steam, and didn’t manage to score any more.</seg>
<seg id="30">Along with the defeat, Honka sank to the bottom of Veikkausliiga league, as there still are seven matches to go before the season ends.</seg>

<seg id="1">Esko Roine confesses: working as an actor destroyed the family</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy-duty work Veteran actor and descendant of a theatre family confesses how working as an actor destroyed his first marriage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Actor Esko Roine turns to 70 next Friday, but it’s probably safe to say that when it comes to him, the age is only a number.</seg>
<seg id="4">I can’t tell any difference when I think about time one year back, or two years or ten years back.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr. Roine retired years ago, but he still works hard, as if he was many men put together.</seg>
<seg id="7">There used to be a joke that there aren’t many plays made in this country without Esko Roine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently Mr. Roine has roles in Helsinki City Theatre play ”Miten menestyä vaivatta liike-elämässä”, in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” and Tampere Comedy Theatre play ”Kvartetti”.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Räppääjä film.</seg>
<seg id="10">PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Roine’s acting career didn’t have a promising start.</seg>
<seg id="12">I wasn’t accepted for the Nativity play in the school.</seg>
<seg id="13">40-50 years later the teacher told me it was because I was so lousy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Esko Roine didn’t give up.</seg>
<seg id="15">The career choice was clear, there weren’t any alternatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">It felt familiar and dear.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in such hurry to get in the industry that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army, so that I could apply for the theatre school as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roine has had over 200 roles in theatre and he has done over 300 TV shows, depending a bit on how one calculates it.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you count the jobs as the Englishmen do, that is counting each TV series episode as a show on its own, the total of the TV jobs amounts to 600.</seg>
<seg id="20">I spent three years in ”Uusi päivä”, which had three episodes per week.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two springs ago I was killed in it, because I hadn’t the time to do it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Commitments until autumn 2016</seg>
<seg id="23">Esko’s elder sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full force, and they’re doing wild roles as anarchist grannies in Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Vielä ehtii”.</seg>
<seg id="24">The younger brother will probably be still hanging out on stages for years to come.</seg>
<seg id="25">That’s what it looks like now, but you never know when you’re talking about a chap of this age.</seg>
<seg id="26">The condition “I’m in if I’ll be alive” applies.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some commitments have been made or promised.</seg>
<seg id="28">The calendar has bookings for the autumn 2016.</seg>
<seg id="29">The years have also left their marks on the man.</seg>
<seg id="30">The age has some collateral effects.</seg>
<seg id="31">The knees have been operated, the hip whistles and osteoarthritis bothers, but as long as you don’t let it bother too much, you can get along, Esko Roine says.</seg>
<seg id="32">TV audience remembers Mr. Roine for example from</seg>
<seg id="33">Merirosvoradio and from a quiz in which he, together with Antti Einiö, gave away ”benknotes”, banknotes worth one hundred marks.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was Antti Einiö who gave away ”benknotes”.</seg>
<seg id="35">I tried to insist that they are banknotes and not benknotes.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the TV series ”Reinikainen” Mr. Roine was the self-important inspector Rautakallio.</seg>
<seg id="37">He became the favorite of the policemen in Tampere, as it turned out that the police department had an inspector similar to him.</seg>
<seg id="38">A policeman once stopped me on the street, lowered the side window and shouted to me: ”That Rautakallio is fantastic!”</seg>
<seg id="39">Right workgroup</seg>
<seg id="40">From theatre works Mr. Roine remembers especially works such as</seg>
<seg id="41">Helsinki City Theatre plays ”Producer” and ”Mestariluokka”, Tampere Workers’ Theatre play ”Kauppamatkustajan kuolema” and Tampere Theatre play ”Pitkän päivän matka yöhön”.</seg>
<seg id="42">A common element among those works is that they all have been popular.</seg>
<seg id="43">I can’t take the credit for it, it’s the workgroup that has succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="44">There have been some low points too.</seg>
<seg id="45">The role of Pekka Puupää in a feature film is one of those.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also others.</seg>
<seg id="47">The reason is that I’ve agreed to do them too easily.</seg>
<seg id="48">I don’t know if I regret those roles or not, but the result doesn’t satisfy neither me nor the audience.</seg>
<seg id="49">As a rank-and-file actor you don’t get to choose your works.</seg>
<seg id="50">You just are a nice boy and do what you’re told.</seg>
<seg id="51">On the side of theatre works Mr. Roine has also sought success in business.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the 80s he ran a restaurant called ”Wanhat Roomeot” in Tampere.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was an instructive experience.</seg>
<seg id="54">It didn’t work out at all when I simultaneously tried to be the executive director of Tampere Theatre, an actor, and then also a restaurateur.</seg>
<seg id="55">If I remember correctly, it became clear in one year that these tasks aren’t compatible in any way.</seg>
<seg id="56">The typical situation was when the performance was about to end, or the interval had started, and I already had been thinking of turning the sauna on, when I received a call from the restaurant, and I was told that my friends had popped in and were hoping to see me after the performance.</seg>
<seg id="57">Memoirs on the occasion of the birthday</seg>
<seg id="58">Esko Roine’s memoirs will be released on his birthday. Ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen have written the book.</seg>
<seg id="59">Well, they’ve managed to cobble up some kind of product out of the memories of a facemaker.</seg>
<seg id="60">Namely, when I used to play in Zoom I was called The Facemaker.</seg>
<seg id="61">They didn’t know me by name at all.</seg>
<seg id="62">The book has been in the making for years.</seg>
<seg id="63">Mr. Roine already told long time ago that there will be no scoops, because he hasn’t done anything so wild, or if he has, he won’t tell it.</seg>
<seg id="64">I wrote a little opening statement for the book.</seg>
<seg id="65">I’m saying in it that if someone is waiting for revelations packed with scandals or good gossip, it is better to stop reading there and then.</seg>
<seg id="66">It contains pretty much stuff related to my profession, both as an actor and as a theatre director.</seg>
<seg id="67">The publisher boasts that there are some stories about hilarious times at the theatre school in the book.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was quite normal student life, but I must admit that when I was a kid I did all kinds of stuff.</seg>
<seg id="69">It wasn’t as wild when Turkka was the director.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was very different.</seg>
<seg id="71">I don’t know how much I got out of it, except for the self-confidence that when I’ve finished the school, I know that I can’t blame that, if my actions won’t get any better.</seg>
<seg id="72">You didn’t have to think, oh how good I would be if I only had gone to school.</seg>
<seg id="73">Mr. Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="74">I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Manni, and Hannes Häyrinen, and got to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="75">There were several legends, starting from my first father-in-law Kaarlo Halttunen.</seg>
<seg id="76">We were very close with Pia Hattara.</seg>
<seg id="77">Tauno Palo is not with us any more, but I managed to get to know him when I was in school.</seg>
<seg id="78">Palo’s second son Martti was on the same course with me.</seg>
<seg id="79">At the theatre school Mr. Roine met his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.</seg>
<seg id="80">The divorce is a painful thing for him to remember.</seg>
<seg id="81">After a relatively long battle the children were split.</seg>
<seg id="82">Not in halves, but the daughter went to the mother, and I got the son.</seg>
<seg id="83">I didn’t think it was a good solution, and as far as I can see the children more or less agree now that they’re adults.</seg>
<seg id="84">It is not rare in the theatre circles that the bonds of matrimony end up being dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="85">In my case it had something to do with the fact that I was working quite a lot also back then.</seg>
<seg id="86">I was in nearly every production.</seg>
<seg id="87">Then there were the TV and radio works on top of that.</seg>
<seg id="88">I was working long hours and the family life suffered because of it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Possibly an evening off on the big day</seg>
<seg id="90">Esko Roine will celebrate at Tampere Workers’ Theatre with the play ”Mielensäpahoittaja” on September 7th.</seg>
<seg id="91">The celebrations will continue in Helsinki City Theatre on September 21st and 28th.</seg>
<seg id="92">”Mielensäpahoittaja” (”I don’t like to complain, but”) is whining there also.</seg>
<seg id="93">I was working when I turned fifty and also when I turned sixty.</seg>
<seg id="94">As such an easily movable play landed in my hands, I thought well, let’s celebrate also the 70th birthday, so that we’ll be done with all that in a blast.</seg>
<seg id="95">Mr. Roine says there will be no celebrations on the actual birthday.</seg>
<seg id="96">I seem to remember that it will be an evening off, but I can’t be sure.</seg>
<seg id="97">I might have booked myself a gig for that day.</seg>
<seg id="98">Or then I’ll have a strange evening off, which I’m going to keep as an evening off, Mr. Roine says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aerospace groups voice concerns over supply chain</seg>
<seg id="2">Some of Britain's smaller aerospace companies have expressed concern that capacity issues in the supply chain could derail the big aircraft makers' ambitious plans to step up production of passenger jets.</seg>
<seg id="3">The thousands of companies that make up the UK's aerospace supply chain are at present benefiting from the launch of an unprecedented number of new aircraft and engine programmes under development in the industry simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="4">IN Aerospace & Defence</seg>
<seg id="5">But while many are celebrating the strong backlog of orders, some have warned that the supply chain is already facing capacity constraints and price pressures.</seg>
<seg id="6">"There is definitely cost pressure and that's coming now with the challenge of volume that is there," says Craig Gallagher, chief executive officer at MB Aerospace, a key supplier to aero-engine manufacturers, such as Rolls-Royce.</seg>
<seg id="7">David Bailey, chief executive of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents about 240 aerospace suppliers across the North West of England, says more capacity is needed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Have we got the strategies and investment plans in line with these growth plans?</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm not sure to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="10">What we need to see is investment in new capital equipment and machines that are required to meet these rates," he says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some companies say part of the problem is the coincidence of new programmes coming to market and an increase in build rates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Andrew Churchill, managing director of JJ Churchill, a gas turbine blade manufacturer, says his company has gone through a "challenging time" after a series of programmes were simultaneously started at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">We went from a position of being quite substantially under capacity to over capacity in the blink of an eye.</seg>
<seg id="14">We went through a period of extensive arrears and trying to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="15">But explaining that it's the compression of programmes that's created a problem doesn't win you any brownie points," Mr Churchill says.</seg>
<seg id="16">JJ Churchill is dealing with the increase in production by investing in £800,000 worth of new machinery and recruiting an additional 26 staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many in the industry believe there needs to be further investment and consolidation among the smaller operators if the UK is to maintain its position as the second - after the US - largest in the aerospace sector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace, a Tyneside-based precision engineer, says the backlog of orders should give suppliers the confidence to expand and increase capacity because the work will be there.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If we don't do that we'll lose out to other countries," Mr Ford says.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some bigger operators are trying to address the problem by acquiring capacity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Senior, the FTSE 250 company that makes aerostructures and engine parts, this year paid £75m to buy UPECA, a Malaysian-based aerospace component manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="22">MB Aerospace has acquired businesses in North America and Poland over the past year.</seg>
<seg id="23">"You can do greenfield start-ups, but in essence the real constraint is the engineering capability and capacity," Mr Gallagher of MB Aerospace says.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both small and large suppliers say they are facing price pressures which are being cascaded down from the big aircraft makers and the aero-engine manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, some believe the worries over problems in the supply chain are being overplayed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aerospace division, who is also president of ADS, the UK's aerospace trade body, says the supply chain is handling the increase in production better than in previous periods.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are some tensions in the supply chain but I wouldn't say they are critical.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's more about the introduction of new technologies and complexities rather than volume," Mr Bryson says.</seg>
<seg id="29">He adds that both Airbus and Boeing have learnt from past mistakes and are being much more careful about ramping up their build rates too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="30">An attempt to increase production in 1997 by Boeing ran into severe difficulties, with the company plunging to a net loss and its factories and supply chain struggling to cope.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tony Wood, head of Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, says he has not yet come across any problems in the supply chain, which provide the majority of the 18,000 components required to make a jet engine.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I'm sure there will be bumps in the road but we're pretty confident that we've done a more thorough job right across our supply chain in selecting the best partners and actually being very close with them as they prepare themselves for ramp up," Mr Wood says.</seg>
<seg id="33">James McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, says its supply chain has been given time to prepare for the increase in build rates.</seg>
<seg id="34">We feel very good about supply chain capability.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have given them visibility which is really important.</seg>
<seg id="36">Meanwhile, Fabrice Brégier, chief executive officer of Airbus passenger jet business, says the company is doing everything possible to mitigate the risks of its planned increase of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Perhaps one of the suppliers will fail so our job is to avoid it, to support them, to look for alternatives, but I don't expect big issues," he says.</seg>
<seg id="38">Mr Brégier adds that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "the quality of the supply chain is the responsibility of the prime contractor.</seg>
<seg id="39">So this is my job and this is the job of Airbus.</seg>

<seg id="2">China rules out full democracy for Hong Kong</seg>
<seg id="3">Pro-democracy activists take to the streets of Hong Kong after China rejects their demands for free elections.</seg>
<seg id="4">Underlining the potential for escalating confrontation, Hong Kong pro-democracy groups have vowed to ensure the city enters an "era of civil disobedience" in protest against proposed voting reforms imposed by the Chinese government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Braving stop-start rain under a gleaming Hong Kong skyline, thousands of demonstrators flocked to a rally organised by pro-democracy group Occupy Central outside the offices of the Legislative Council on Sunday night, where they were urged to stage mass sit-ins to cripple the city's financial district.</seg>
<seg id="6">It came just hours after Beijing said it would deny voters the right to publicly nominate candidates for the city's 2017 chief executive election, pushing back against months of rallies and street demonstrations that have increasingly polarised the city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Protesters take part in the rally for the beginning of Occupy Central movement outside Central Government Offices in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is about wanting a fair and proper election," said web-page editor Dion Tse, 24, who attended Sunday's rally with her 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.</seg>
<seg id="9">The central government doesn't respect the voice of Hong Kong people.</seg>
<seg id="10">We want them to hear our voice and to see the determination of Hong Kong people.</seg>
<seg id="11">China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, approved plans for the voting reform which will see two to three candidates allowed to stand in Hong Kong's first direct election.</seg>
<seg id="12">But with the majority approval of a 1200-strong nomination committee needed, opposition politicians said those with dissenting political views would effectively have no chance of getting on the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Protesters take part in a rally during the Ocuppy Central with Love and Peace protest at Tamar Park outside of the Hong Kong Government Building.</seg>
<seg id="14">Police estimated more than 2600 attended the rally at its peak.</seg>
<seg id="15">A heavy police presence kept watch as about 100 protesters, led by student group Scholarism, converged on the Grand Hyatt late on Sunday, where Communist Party official Li Fei was scheduled to stay after arriving from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Occupy Central co-founder Benny Tai fronted a press conference with members of other organisations including the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism, and the Federation of Students.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Tai did not give an exact date for when the blockade would take place for legal reasons, but urged participants to pay attention to developments in "the next week or two," adding the city would official enter an "era of civil disobedience."</seg>
<seg id="18">Benny Tai answers questions from the media.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Look at the person next to you," he said at Sunday's rally, standing in front of a billboard plastered with the two Chinese characters for "disobey."</seg>
<seg id="20">That person will be occupying Central with you!</seg>
<seg id="21">The convenor of Scholarism, 17-year-old Joshua Wong, said earlier that preparations for high school student strikes were underway and would dovetail with the thousands of university students also expected to boycott classes.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In addition to our academic responsibility, we also have our social responsibility," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">In Beijing, Li Fei, a deputy secretary-general of the NPC standing committee, told reporters that advocating for "international standards" on universal suffrage was a "waste of time" propagated by some Hong Kong politicians seeking to "confuse and mislead" society.</seg>
<seg id="24">"A lot of time has been wasted before in the debate of impractical suggestions such as public nomination," Mr Li said, insisting that the electoral method should be made in accordance with the true situation and legal framework of each society.</seg>
<seg id="25">To become law, the universal suffrage bill will require a super-majority of two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-member legislature to pass, meaning the legislation could be stopped by the 27 opposition members in government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Li warned that Hong Kong could be dragged into protracted political debate if the reform proposal was vetoed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It would be harmful to the business environment and the city's development," he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Almost 800,000 people voted in an unofficial referendum organised by Occupy Central in June against China's insistence that candidates be vetted through a committee.</seg>
<seg id="29">As many as 172,000 people marched to push for democracy on July 1, while a pro-Beijing anti-Occupy Central march on August 17 attracted about 88,000, according to estimates by the University of Hong Kong, though police and organiser estimates varied considerably.</seg>

<seg id="2">A consultant has been suspended and the NHS has stopped referring patients to a private hospital for cataract operations after reported problems.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two people attended Torbay Hospital A&E department after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.</seg>
<seg id="4">Torbay Hospital, in Devon, said it contacted 19 patients treated on 26 July for an "urgent clinical review."</seg>
<seg id="5">Mount Stuart apologised and said an inquiry was under way after the consultant's suspension.</seg>
<seg id="6">Torbay Hospital was made aware of the problem when two patients attended its A&E department with eyesight problems after treatment at Mount Stuart.</seg>
<seg id="7">It said none of the 19 NHS patients - all seen on the same day - have needed corrective surgery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group have stopped referring patients to Mount Stuart following the concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">David Sinclair, interim medical director at South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, said: "We identified this problem at an early stage and were able to recall all the patients affected very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whenever we refer patients to providers, we carry out quality and safety checks and ensure that they meet current legislative and registration requirements.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gill Gant, director for patient safety at South Devon and Torbay Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "Patient safety is always the absolute priority, so it is important that these cataract operations are paused until we have absolute assurance that the service is safe."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ramsay Health Care UK, which runs Mount Stuart, said it offered "its sincere apologies to all patients who suffered complications."</seg>
<seg id="13">It said: "As soon as we realised that there was a potential problem all patients were recalled by Mount Stuart Hospital and then by Torbay Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="14">The consultant concerned has had practising privileges with Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.</seg>
<seg id="15">To date he has completed 4,537 cataracts across the organisation and has a history of delivering excellent clinical outcomes with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mount Stuart added the consultant had been suspended while investigations took place.</seg>

<seg id="2">Notorious anonymous message board first to post leaked celebrity nudes</seg>
<seg id="3">But just what is 4chan and why was it the hacker's first port of call to post the stolen photographs?</seg>
<seg id="4">First created in 2003, 4chan is a controversial message board that's reviled as much as it is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The site is sub-divided into a number of sections or "boards" where anonymous users can discuss everything from video games and travel to pornography and hacking.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unlike other online forums, users don't create consistent identities and posts aren't recorded.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the more popular boards comments can disappear within minutes as they're pushed "off the bottom of the page" by newer posts.</seg>
<seg id="8">These two factors have created 4chan's chaotic, anarchic and surprisingly creative atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="9">As an anonymous collective, its users are responsible for some of the best known internet memes online (including rickrolling and lolcats) but its lack of regulation means it's also home to a great deal of questionable and straight-forwardly criminal content.</seg>
<seg id="10">The site's most popular board is /b/, designated for "random" discussions, and is frequently filled with NSFW or "Not Safe for Work" content.</seg>

<seg id="1">CytRx is pouring money into R&D of cancer-fighting drugs</seg>
<seg id="2">CytRx Corp. is on a mission to cure cancer - or at least slow it down.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Los Angeles biopharmaceutical company, which recently has become embroiled in a stock-promotion controversy, specializes in researching and developing drugs to treat cancers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The most promising medication, aldoxorubicin, is a more advanced version of the widely used chemotherapy drug doxorubicin.</seg>
<seg id="5">CytRx is conducting clinical trials of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and recurrent glioblastoma, or brain cancer.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body.- Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx, on the cancer-fighting drug aldoxorubicin</seg>
<seg id="7">Aldoxorubicin contains a so-called linker technology that essentially acts like a Trojan horse.</seg>
<seg id="8">It binds directly to a protein in the bloodstream that also accumulates in tumors, enabling the drug to be delivered directly to cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="9">The linker releases the drug only in an acidic environment, which occurs in cancer cells but not in healthy tissue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The technology enables patients to be treated with higher and additional doses of the cancer-fighting drug.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's sort of like a guided missile that goes to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," said Steven Kriegsman, chief executive of CytRx.</seg>
<seg id="12">Like many biotech companies that focus on developing drugs, CytRx isn't profitable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The company issued stock this year, raising about $86 million for operations and research.</seg>
<seg id="14">CytRx is in the middle of recruiting 400 patients worldwide for its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of a second-line treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.</seg>
<seg id="15">Soft-tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat.</seg>
<seg id="16">A second-line treatment is used when the first-line treatment against the cancer fails.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The drug could then gain approval by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="19">Analysts said CytRx released data in December from an earlier clinical trial that indicated aldoxorubicin was a promising treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For a long time, there was a question of 'We haven't seen clinical data, how different is it from the underlying drug?'" said Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co.</seg>
<seg id="21">The release of the results substantiated in a lot of people's mind that it is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">But Fein said it is hard to predict the outcome and timeline of the current clinical trial because it significantly differs from the previous one that produced good results.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of things need to go right," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fein compared developing drugs to the mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You invest a lot of money looking for that one spot on the ground that bears gold, and up until you find that spot you continue to pour money in," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up until you successfully commercialize the drug, it's a continual R&D spend.</seg>
<seg id="27">CytRx has been hit with multiple shareholder lawsuits contending that the company unfairly touted its performance.</seg>
<seg id="28">The lawsuits accused the company of hiring the investor relations firm DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired writers to promote CytRx and another biotech firm through articles on websites such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.</seg>
<seg id="29">The articles didn't disclose that they were commissioned by the companies, the lawsuits alleged.</seg>
<seg id="30">In response to the news, Seeking Alpha said it had removed articles "that were in violation of our policies."</seg>
<seg id="31">Several stories about the company also disappeared from other websites.</seg>
<seg id="32">Kriegsman declined to comment on the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="33">The company has hired outside counsel to defend against the lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It's not something I have time or energy to focus on," he said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Kriegsman said a real challenge facing CytRx is hiring talented employees, who tend to flock to the biotech centers of San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.</seg>
<seg id="36">"It's sort of a wasteland in many ways here" for the pharmaceutical industry, he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">Analyst views</seg>
<seg id="38">Shares of CytRx hit $8.08 on Jan. 10, then plunged to below $3 in April after the stock promotion allegations surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="39">Analyst said the lawsuits and negative publicity have pushed the stock price down further than the fundamentals of the company would warrant.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It's unfortunate," Fein said, "but I am not sure there is an easy way to get around that as long as the perception is there."</seg>

<seg id="1">The question regarding an external killer is going to stand out as the crucial element in the Ulvila killing process, which started today in the Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2">Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Court of Appeal in Vaasa will hear the case now for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court along with the new evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The intention of the Court of Appeal is to give the sentence before the current year ends.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, the court considered the possibility of an external killer likely enough.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opening speech, the District Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala relayed the prosecutor’s view about the murder night, and about those factors which exclude the possibility of an external killer.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that the crucial question is whether an external person has entered the house and killed Jukka Lahti in a way and in the time Anneli Auer has told.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer’s account,” Kulmala says.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the prosecutor, the homicide started from a domestic dispute, during which Ms Auer had announced that she will leave home and file for divorce.</seg>
<seg id="11">At some point they moved to the kitchen, where Mr Lahti held Ms Auer and tried to stop her from leaving.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of them took the kitchen knife,” Kulmala described the murder night events on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the prosecutor, several factors prove that there was no external person present.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, the emergency call recording doesn’t contain any sounds of an external person.</seg>
<seg id="15">Auer’s eldest child – daughter – told in an interrogation that she saw the killer, when the man exited the fireplace room door.</seg>
<seg id="16">The acquittal ruled by the Court of Appeal of Vaasa in 2011 was partially based on the daughter’s account.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the prosecutor the daughter’s observation can’t be true.</seg>
<seg id="18">”The daughter didn’t see any external killer in her parents’ bedroom, even if she went to see there twice,” Kulmala said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prosecutor’s new witness is connected exactly to the possibility of an external killer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jukka S. Lahti’s sister has told about what happened in the hospital after the murder night.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the woman, the only thing the daughter told in the hospital was that she only saw Lahti’s body when she went to the killing scene in the fireplace room.</seg>
<seg id="22">Auer’s defence is going to present the court with investigation lines the weight of which the police hasn’t, according to the defence, investigated sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the Court of Appeal of Vaasa acquitted Ms Auer three years ago, the court deemed the male DNA found on a billet as one reference of an external person.</seg>
<seg id="24">Later the sample turned out to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="25">At that time, a mass DNA sample was taken from 700 persons.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, a significant amount of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded,” defence attorney Juha Manner said.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the defence’s new witnesses tells about a possible external killer.</seg>
<seg id="28">A woman from Ulvila told the police about a man from Pori, who, according to the woman’s account, had confessed the killing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police interrogated the man in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="30">The prosecutor deliberated that the man from Pori didn’t have anything to do with the homicide.</seg>
<seg id="31">The prosecutor filed a request for examination for the woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman has lied in her account.</seg>
<seg id="32">The other new witness of the defence is the nurse who was on duty on the murder night at Satakunta Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="33">The District Court of Satakunta gave Auer a life sentence for murder last December.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to the District Court sentence, the elements against the possibility of an external killer include for example the accounts of Auer’s children, the missing sounds referring to an external killer on the emergency call recording, as well as the time required by the course of the events.</seg>
<seg id="35">The sentence was given with votes 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="36">The judge representing the minority in the voting wrote that in a crime case a conflicting evidence must be considered in favour of the dependant.</seg>
<seg id="37">For that reason, the daughter’s account must be interpreted so, that notwithstanding the discrepancies in the account she had seen an external killer exiting the fireplace room door.</seg>
<seg id="38">Auer’s two eldest children have been summoned before the court.</seg>
<seg id="39">The daughter was heard personally for the first time last year at the District Court of Satakunta.</seg>
<seg id="40">When heard before the court, she couldn’t recall the murder night events any more.</seg>
<seg id="41">Auer’s second child named the mother as the killer in a video interrogation in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="42">The son told he had heard what happened on the murder night through a closed door.</seg>
<seg id="43">He also told that Auer had been planning the murder for six months.</seg>
<seg id="44">As a plaintiff the son has no obligation to state anything before the Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="45">The hearing of the Court of Appeal will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.</seg>
<seg id="46">If necessary, the hearing of Anneli Auer will continue also tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="47">Anneli Auer is currently serving a sentence of over seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.</seg>

<seg id="1">Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?</seg>
<seg id="2">He'S public enemy number one at the moment thanks to his actions in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="3">And with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to attend the G20 summit held in Brisbane in November, whether or not he should be allowed into the country is a matter of hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the weekend, punk-rock activists Pussy Riot called for Australia to ban Putin from attending the global summit, which includes more than 4000 delegates from the world's most powerful nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We think that this person has no place at the G20," Maria Alyokhina told a packed Sydney Opera House at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, with Kiev warning it's on the brink of "full-scale war" and Putin referring to parts of Ukraine as "Novorossiya" or "new Russia," should we really be welcoming here?</seg>
<seg id="7">Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Lowy Institute's G20 studies centre director Mike Callaghan said although the meeting is held in Australia, it's not really up to us who comes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Australia can say who comes into the country but it's an international meeting," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much like New York hosts meetings for the UN or Washington hosts meetings for the IMF, Mr Callaghan said "it's not up to the hosts to say 'you can't come.'"</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, Tony Abbott said he is "weighing" the decision after Russia's "reprehensible" actions in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very important question.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because he would be coming for a critical international gathering, it's not a decision which Australia really has a right to make unilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nevertheless, it is an important question and it's one that I'll be weighing and I suspect a number of other countries will be weighing in the weeks ahead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">People attend an anti-war meeting Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="16">The event takes place over two days and includes a mix of the world's biggest and emerging economies which accounts for about two thirds of the global population, 85 per cent of its GDP and 75 per cent of global trade.</seg>
<seg id="17">Members range from Canada to China, France, Japan, Russia, the US and European Union with special invites for a selection of non-G20 members such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Callaghan said Australia was in the unenviable position of having to balance diverse interests under intense public pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the best way for the Prime Minister to handle it was to use the opportunity to grill Russia on what they have been up to.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The Prime Minister should say "We will be using this opportunity to have a very frank discussion and I will be demanding for President Putin to account for his actions."</seg>
<seg id="21">To put the onus on if he comes, he will have to face scrutiny," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Quite clearly we're seeing a rise in geopolitical tensions.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think the world would be expecting them to talk about these things.</seg>
<seg id="24">Pro-Russian rebels prepare arms for the assault on the positions of Ukrainian army in Donetsk airport, eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's still unclear whether Putin will attend the event and Mr Callaghan said we may not now until days before.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is probably the last thing on his mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">I don't think he's going to say "I have to change my attitude on Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November.""</seg>
<seg id="28">Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said while he had the "gravest reservations about that man, Mr Putin, coming to Australia," he understands the fact it's an international conference.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is probably time for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to be talking to other nations, other members of the G20, about whether it is appropriate for Mr Putin to come to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.</seg>
<seg id="31">But following the tragic events of MH17, the complete lack of remorse or responsibility, the lack of full co-operation in terms of MH17, and now, scenes of thousands of Russian soldiers flooding across the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have grave reservations about welcoming Mr Putin to Australia.</seg>

<seg id="1">German business attacks "complacent" Berlin</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany has become "overconfident" and "complacent," with the government pursuing policies that put the country's hard-won competitiveness at risk, some of Germany's top business leaders warn.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their criticisms of chancellor Angela Merkel's government come as Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing, raising concerns about its ability to continue driving growth in the stagnant eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their remarks follow the introduction of policies fiercely opposed by corporate Germany such as the introduction of a minimum wage and a reduction in the retirement age to 63 for certain long-serving workers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I think the biggest threat right now is really a kind of overconfidence in Germany, and with that comes a little bit of complacency," said Kurt Bock, the chief executive of BASF, the world's biggest chemical maker by sales.</seg>
<seg id="6">IN EU Economy</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In general the feeling is that we're doing well, we have money to spend, we have relatively low unemployment, so what's the problem?"</seg>
<seg id="8">I think that is a big risk.</seg>
<seg id="9">You can see it in German government policies that we are not really growth-orientated or business-friendly, but rather much more orientated towards the distribution of wealth and serving the expectations of certain stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="10">Markus Kerber, managing director of the BDI, the German industry association, said: "Germany is now in a very good position.</seg>
<seg id="11">But in the next 10 years every economy in the developed world must change. ...[In Germany] the reform agenda is not making the progress that it did in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The DIHK, the national chamber of commerce, has also railed against the recent policy moves.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany continues to enjoy low levels of unemployment and an almost-balanced budget; even consumption, once languid, is growing.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, poor second-quarter GDP figures have underscored the vulnerability of the export-driven German economy to external shocks, such as from Russia and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="15">GDP dropped 0.2 per cent in the three months to June, compared to the previous quarter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Germany's lacklustre performance threatens to make the European Central Bank's battle against low inflation even harder and could make quantitative easing more likely.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Kerber urged the government to "switch back from public consumption to public investment," for example by focusing future spending increases more on infrastructure and less on pensions.</seg>
<seg id="18">He argued that the Merkel government was reaping the rewards of the tough policies enacted in the early 2000s by her Social Democrat predecessor, Gerhard Schröder.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stefan Heidbreder, managing director at the Stiftung Familienunternehmen, a foundation for family-owned businesses, said: "Germany is still in a good position, compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is thanks to its companies and less to do with the policies of the government . . .</seg>
<seg id="21">The experience of our neighbour, France, shows that doling out lots of money for social benefits and intervening to limit freedom to conduct business are the wrong course.</seg>
<seg id="22">A leading German investment banker was more blunt, describing recent government policies as a "disaster."</seg>
<seg id="23">Germany risks forgetting everything it has worked hard to achieve in order to just please the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's my key concern right now," the banker said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr Bock said the new government coalition's energy reforms had failed to tackle the underlying weaknesses in policy which has left industry facing uncompetitive costs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vacationer killed by Baltic Sea bacteria</seg>
<seg id="2">Six people were infected with a bacteria from the Caribbean which has made itself at home in the popular German vacation destination.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of them is now in a coma.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, though most-concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">It spreads best in brackish waters with temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This could be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, the first director of State Office of Health and Welfare (LAGuS) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is just as prevalent in Denmark, Poland, and all along the German coast.</seg>
<seg id="8">The victim had been holidaying on the island of Usedom at the end of July, according (LAGuS).</seg>
<seg id="9">He passed away at the beginning of August.</seg>
<seg id="10">Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks and there is a possibility he will lose a leg.</seg>
<seg id="11">He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small open wound on his leg.</seg>
<seg id="12">He went to the hospital after noticing on the drive home that his leg had turned blue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Doctors diagnosed blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My husband would not have been in the Baltic Sea under any circumstances had he known about the danger," his wife, Sonja Bruehl, told the Ostsee Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">His serious illness and the havoc the sepsis has brought to him and his family could have been avoided with better information, such as a notice from the resort.</seg>
<seg id="16">LAGuS told dpa news agency that doctors were told to look out for infections at the beginning of the summer, though no public notice was given.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cooler temperatures have made the already low risk of contracting the bacteria even more nominal.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The results we have from [Monday's] tests showed a stark decrease in the presence of V. vulnificus," Dr. Will said.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cooler temperatures have done their job.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vibrio vulnificus, a relative to the bacteria that causes cholera, is especially harmful to those with chronic liver disease and compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or diabetes and the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Men are also at a higher risk as oestrogen has shown to have a protective effect against the pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="22">If it takes hold, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wounds infected by the bacteria have a mortality rate of approximately 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">The bacteria can also infect people through the ingestion of seafood containing V. vulnificus, though Dr. Will said that is not the case here.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is mostly in the southern hemisphere where the seafood is also infected.</seg>
<seg id="26">The last recorded deaths in Germany from V. vulnificus poisoning were in 2010, when the bacteria claimed two victims.</seg>

<seg id="2">Revelation Singer Vieno Kekkonen, who will turn 80, is doing gigs and working out often, but she also has had to fear for her health.</seg>
<seg id="3">It surely is unbelievable that radiant Vieno Kekkonen is already turning 80.</seg>
<seg id="4">She’s astounded herself, too, about how the years suddenly are so many.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven’t really realized that I’m this old.</seg>
<seg id="6">80 sounds really a lot, Vieno Kekkonen says, letting out a laughter.</seg>
<seg id="7">The birthday will be spent with family.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the end of August, a birthday celebration was organized for her by a folk music and pensioner association in Karttula, where she lived as a child.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place where my grandfather was born.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was completely bemused by the celebration, the birthday lady says, referring to the event where the stage, fit for three hundred, was cramped with people who wanted to congratulate her.</seg>
<seg id="11">A couple of days later, in Muhos, there was an event to greet Armi Kuusela, the life of whom Vieno Kekkonen remembers having followed when she was young.</seg>
<seg id="12">And now we’re both this old!</seg>
<seg id="13">Vieno Kekkonen laughs.</seg>
<seg id="14">During her long career there only are few sides of Vieno Kekkonen that haven’t been seen in the public.</seg>
<seg id="15">One thing she has never told publicly: in 2006 she had an unilateral mastectomy.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was an ambiguous finding on my breast in such spot that it was decided to remove the breast completely.</seg>
<seg id="17">Eventually it wasn’t cancer, which of course made me happy.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the same operation a new breast was made, so it was a rather large operation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vieno Kekkonen hasn’t thought that losing her breast was in a way unnecessary, because the awareness of an ambiguous finding would have been a heavy burden to bear, and such thing can’t be not taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="20">I was just so relieved when it wasn’t anything serious, Vieno Kekkonen says, and notes that for younger women losing a breast is surely more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1">Farmers being made the party responsible for the sea condition</seg>
<seg id="2">The level of the discussion about the bad conditions of the Baltic Sea in connection with the Finnish agriculture is depressing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The voice of the experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the summer, especially Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have insisted on agriculture’s responsibility for the nutrient emissions in the Baltic Sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the same breath, quick actions for getting the emissions under control have been demanded.</seg>
<seg id="6">Compared to few environment researchers, and journalists who have studied the matter with their help, an average farmer seems a supreme nutrient expert.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farmers know that the nutrient wash can’t originate from farming, if the same amount of nutrients has been sowed into the field as it is being harvested from it.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Finland, nearly all farms have committed themselves to the environment program.</seg>
<seg id="9">The program strictly restricts the use of the fertilizers, and it requires accurate tracking and reporting of the nutrient balance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The authorities monitor that the conditions are being followed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The nutrients which are accumulated in the field have washed up into the waterways also after the fertilizer restrictions, but also in this matter a clear diminishing in the emissions has been evident for years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The farmers have the willingness and the capacity to work further in order to reduce the nutrient emissions.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, everyone should understand that the zero level is impossible to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">”If the goal is to have such an amount of agriculture production that it approximately meets the consumption, you just have to accept that it’s like this,” says Jyrki Aakkula, the director of environment research in MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MT, August 29th).</seg>
<seg id="15">The past summer brought large blue-green algae accumulations to the Gulf of Finland.</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers agreed quite unanimously that the algae drew its growth force from the sea’s own phosphorus reserves.</seg>
<seg id="17">The phosphorus accumulated in the bottom of the sea comes partially from the coast countries’ agriculture during the past decades, but can’t explain the accumulation alone.</seg>
<seg id="18">The cleaning of the waste waters of the growing cities on the Baltic Sea coasts was neglected until the end of 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="19">The problem concerned also the waste waters of the Greater Helsinki and they weren’t considered a problem except in terms of contamination of city’s own shores.</seg>
<seg id="20">The contamination of the shores was prevented by building, still as late as in the 1980s, a waste water tube which reached the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">The quality of the water conducted to it has of course improved over the years.</seg>
<seg id="22">The nutrients that have ended up in the sea in the past won’t disappear, even if the agriculture would be terminated completely in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="23">And yet, every summer, the blue-green algae discussion, and the raised accusations always target today’s agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="24">The public debate stigmatises the farmer as the responsible for the Baltic Sea’s condition.</seg>
<seg id="25">The accusation is excessive, but it becomes even more troublesome when it’s being used as a mean to fulfil political ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Greens are driving great changes in the environment norms for the agriculture, lead by the Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Niinistö has used this summer’s algae debate as a stepping stone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Niinistö has accused, using harsh words, the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) for being antiquated, and has considered it the most difficult obstacle for the water protection.</seg>
<seg id="29">Also the political rhetoric should have a limit.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the special projects related to the water protection are explicitly based on the cooperation between MTK, farmers, and environment administration.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Niinistö’s offensive style serves more the attempts to lure the votes of the urban green voters, than the water protection.</seg>
<seg id="32">Well, that’s probably its purpose.</seg>
<seg id="33">By using hard talk the Greens are preparing themselves for leaving the government.</seg>
<seg id="34">In case of policy changes, the MTK’s task is to take care of the subsistence of their members.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is difficult to sell expensive changes to farmers, if you can’t get a reimburse for the expenses.</seg>
<seg id="36">The only funds Ville Niinistö has talked about, are the cuts from other agriculture funds.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Abbott government's latest attempt to scrap the mining tax appears doomed with Clive Palmer declaring his senators will vote it down without changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Labor also fears the government has included a measure in a new repeal bill that could limit increases to compulsory superannuation contributions by employers out to 2034.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government amid confusion and heated Labor indignation used its numbers in parliament's lower house on Monday to rush through its repeal legislation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It laid aside the original repeal bill, which the Senate previously had amended heavily, and replaced it with new legislation initially described as relating to tax, superannuation, social security and family assistance.</seg>
<seg id="6">Essentially, it was a bill that repealed the "failed" mining tax, plus a range of associated measures including the low-income superannuation contribution (saving $3.6 billion), the income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the schoolkids bonus ($4.7 billion).</seg>
<seg id="7">Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer was dismissive of the government move.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Ill-conceived mining tax repeal bill wont pass Senate without low income super contribution, income support bonus & the schoolkids bonus," he tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government needs the support of PUP and other crossbenchers to have its bill clear the Senate against opposition from Labor and the Greens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove parliament's ability to decide the rate of the superannuation compulsory guarantee, giving all the authority to the treasurer to determine any changes.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is outrageous," he told reporters in Canberra.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would allow the government to delay further increases, pushing out Labor's desired target of 12 per cent rate to as far as 2034.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That is completely unacceptable and the Labor party of course will oppose that all the way," Mr Bowen said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rate is now 9.5 per cent, but the government wants the treasurer to have the power to pause further increases.</seg>

<seg id="2">Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) says it finds it difficult to accept the new estimation from the facility supplier Areva, according to which the third reactor of Olkiluoto will only be available for commercial use in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jouni Silvennoinen, the director of the power station project, says that the reason for this is for example the fact that the construction is largely complete, and the amount of uncompleted work is known.</seg>
<seg id="4">TVO continues assessing the information received from Areva.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Silvennoinen says in his statement that TVO welcomes all initiatives which allow the project to be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Areva provided TVO with the updated schedule concerning the Olkiluoto 3 today, and according to the schedule the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016, and the commercial activity could start in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Areva’s statement, the project’s latest delays are due mainly to the acceptance of the automation system of the reactor. The acceptance was obtained in April.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was preceded by negotiations with TVO which took four years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally, Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time after another.</seg>
<seg id="10">TVO and Areva have been quarrelling about who is responsible for the delay for years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The dispute has been taken to the Court of Arbitration, and Areva has demanded no less than 2.7 billion euros in damages from TVO.</seg>
<seg id="12">TVO considers Areva’s claims unfounded, and is demanding approximately 1.8 billion euros from the company.</seg>

<seg id="2">Global leaders gathered in Stockholm today for the 24th annual World Water Week, urging the energy and water communities to work together to face some of the main challenges of our time, providing clean drinking water and energy for a growing world population.</seg>
<seg id="3">The theme of 2014 World Water Week is "Energy and Water."</seg>
<seg id="4">Water and energy are interdependent in more ways than not.</seg>
<seg id="5">We need energy for pumping, storing, transporting and treating water, we need water for producing almost all sorts of energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">An increase or decrease in one will immediately affect the other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The two resources are also inseparable from sustainable development and must be tirelessly promoted in global decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="8">Addressing the opening session of the Week, Mr. Torgny Holmgren, Executive Director of World Water Week organiser Stockholm International Water Institute, said: "The challenges are immense."</seg>
<seg id="9">With the global demand for water projected to grow by 55 per cent between 2000 and 2050 and electricity demand expected to increase by 50 per cent in the next two decades, there is an urgent need for a closer relationship between the energy and water communities if we are to provide solutions for all peoples to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="10">Professor John Briscoe, this year's Stockholm Water Prize laureate, spoke about water as a platform for growth, both of other sectors and society as a whole, and said that "developing countries face big challenges.</seg>
<seg id="11">They have yet to mobilise those resources.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that there is "no eternal solution [to the water crisis], neither here nor there."</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, there is a cycle of challenges and responses.</seg>
<seg id="14">In over 100 seminars, workshops and events spread throughout the week, delegates will discuss ongoing and future work and collaboration between the energy and water communities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Professor John Briscoe, a native of South Africa, will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, during a ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.</seg>

<seg id="2">In October 2012 a raft carrying twenty-three Cuban refugees on its way to Miami capsized and a reported fourteen people drowned.</seg>
<seg id="3">It had happened to hundreds more before them, and they surely will not be the last.</seg>
<seg id="4">Every year more than 1,000 Central Americans die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.</seg>
<seg id="5">The transnational city is a place to die for.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ironically, however, once established in the transnational city, few envision staying there until their last breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">For many, it is a temporary venue, whether as a place of exile, a springboard for upward mobility, or a playground until new opportunities beckon.</seg>
<seg id="8">Few imagine dying there and, as the moment draws near, many make plans to go home.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the transnational city, which is home to a disproportionate number of the foreign-born and expatriates, death and repatriation are a steady business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bodies of an estimated 20 percent of South Florida's deceased are shipped out, more than from any other region in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of the HRs (industry shorthand for human remains) going abroad depart from Miami International Airport.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the CEO of Pierson, a leader in this business since 1964, around 80 percent of business is international, with the company shipping to a range of foreign destinations across Central and South America and a number of European countries as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">Source: Aer Lingus</seg>
<seg id="14">As more and more migrants move to transnational cities, they too die there.</seg>
<seg id="15">And even in death, there are still costs to return home.</seg>
<seg id="16">Miami is the hub for American Airlines in Latin America, and the figures in the table are the airline's rates for repatriating human remains in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cost of shipping a body is not cheap, ranging from about $500 to well into the thousands of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="18">The requirements for the shipment and delivery of HRs also vary for religious, cultural, and public health reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">Given the expense and the lack of government assistance to repatriate the dead, who are often young and uninsured, immigrant communities in transnational cities sometimes organize burial societies to help offset costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">The origins of some credit unions and informal health insurance programs can be traced back to such societies established by Italians, Jews, and Greeks in New York, who were among the first transnationals in America.</seg>
<seg id="21">Newer generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos, and Bangladeshis are now doing the same in several transnational cities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Source: American Airlines</seg>
<seg id="23">Clearly, dying abroad does not come without complications because few expats intend or plan to make the transnational city their eternal home.</seg>
<seg id="24">For instance, in Dubai, in the absence of a will for a deceased expat, Sharia law is applied and supersedes the laws governing inheritance in the deceased's home country.</seg>
<seg id="25">All assets, if there are any, are frozen and subsequently dispersed at the discretion of the Sharia court.</seg>

<seg id="28">At one time discontinued, the human remains service was reinstated by the airline in 2004 after condemnation by emigrant groups.</seg>
<seg id="29">The thought of dying rarely enters the minds of those passing through or living in a transnational city.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the contrary, becoming an expat or immigrant in the transnational city is an open declaration about how one views life, not death.</seg>
<seg id="31">Yet it is in the approach of death that the transnational city offers the foreign-born its most stark and ultimate choices of belonging--between the local and global, between cosmos and earth, and between the transient and eternal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The opposition parties Centre Party and Left Alliance are going to submit to the government an interpellation concerning the subsistence of the persons with low income, and the increasing inequality.</seg>
<seg id="3">The parties want to instigate debate about people’s subsistence problems, which are culminating due to the weak economy development and the worsening unemployment.</seg>

<seg id="6">The reality is that there are nearly half million people unemployed now, the parties say in their statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also the subsistence problems of the people in employment have worsened.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is it worth asking a rhetorical question?</seg>
<seg id="2">Everyone knows about rhetorical questions, don't they?</seg>
<seg id="3">Don't answer that.</seg>
<seg id="4">This figure of speech - a question that does not anticipate an answer but implies one - peppers everything from the highest-flown oratory to everyday conversational exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="5">The opening of Cicero's famous denunciation of Catiline is a run of rhetorical questions, starting: "When, O Catiline, do you mean to cease abusing our patience?"</seg>
<seg id="6">So are my arguments with my wife: "What's wrong with reheating five-day-old chicken for the kids?"</seg>
<seg id="7">Why are you so uptight?</seg>
<seg id="8">The fancy term for rhetorical questions is erotema.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their virtue is in taking what might be an open question and forcing the audience to accept it as a given.</seg>
<seg id="10">They imply, sneakily, that nobody sane could possibly disagree.</seg>
<seg id="11">The author of a 19th-century composition manual, David Williams, described them as "a mode of address admirably calculated to produce a powerful impression of the truth of a subject, as it challenges the impossibility of contradiction."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Art of Persuasion</seg>
<seg id="13">You can string them together for more ambitious effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">A succession of rhetorical questions designed to express grief or indignation is called epiplexis.</seg>
<seg id="15">You find these in Job's appeals to the Almighty: "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress . . .?</seg>
<seg id="16">Hast thou eyes of flesh?</seg>
<seg id="17">Or seest thou as man seeth?</seg>
<seg id="18">Also in comments from my wife: "Why did you give the children food poisoning?</seg>
<seg id="19">Are you mad?</seg>
<seg id="20">Can't you do anything right?</seg>
<seg id="21">Or there's hypophora, which is where you ask a question and immediately answer it.</seg>
<seg id="22">A fine example is furnished by Isaac Hayes: "Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?</seg>
<seg id="23">Shaft!</seg>
<seg id="24">Ya damn right!</seg>
<seg id="25">Who's the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?</seg>
<seg id="26">Also, my wife: "What's the one thing they've eaten that could have made them sick?"</seg>
<seg id="27">That chicken.</seg>
<seg id="28">Which idiot fed it to them?</seg>
<seg id="29">You.</seg>
<seg id="30">Oddly, however, despite rhetoric being the art of persuasion, a rhetorical question is often not all that persuasive.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you are in the business of talking someone round, rather than preaching to the converted or railing against the obdurate, you should use rhetorical questions with caution.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are better at consolidating assent than winning it.</seg>
<seg id="33">If your audience agrees with the proposition - "Isn't it nice it's so sunny?" - a rhetorical question signals the speaker's confidence in that and so, as it were, binds speaker and audience closer.</seg>
<seg id="34">But it will only do that if you are sure there is no room for dissent.</seg>
<seg id="35">By presuming on agreement rather than asking for it, you can sound, well, presumptuous.</seg>
<seg id="36">In other circumstances, rhetorical questions indicate the weak point in an argument.</seg>
<seg id="37">Where they appear in newspaper headlines they are all too often obvious as the strongest available statement of a very weak case: "Did aliens build the pyramids?"</seg>
<seg id="38">In both instances they are vulnerable to the straightforward takedown of giving an answer, and not the one implied.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the high-risk general election campaign slogan of the British Conservative party in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="40">It lost.</seg>
<seg id="41">To some, spotting this sort of thing has become a hobby, and QTWAIN (Questions To Which Answer Is No) - popularised by British journalist John Rentoul - has taken hold.</seg>
<seg id="42">Some years ago a friend ran a competition to find the best examples.</seg>
<seg id="43">The clear winner was "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?," as sung by pop star Gary Glitter - before he was revealed to be a child-sex offender.</seg>
<seg id="44">The writer is the author of "You Talkin" to Me?"</seg>

<seg id="2">In the beginning of the conflict the thought was that a federation could be a some kind of compromise for the conflict, Saari says.</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier, in an interview with a Russian channel, Russian President Vladimir Putin said reaching the peace in the eastern Ukraine requires talks on the statehood of the area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In practice, this would mean some sort of autonomy in eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of the people living in the eastern part.</seg>
<seg id="6">Saari says Ukraine’s change into a federation is in a certain way a priority among the objectives Russia is aiming at.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ukraine suspects, probably for a reason, that Russia would attempt to affect Ukraine’s internal affairs, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the federation solution can’t be reached, an alternative, from Russia’s point of view, could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia virtually would have the control over Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimates.</seg>
<seg id="9">The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both arms and soldiers to the east.</seg>
<seg id="10">Russia has denied the claims, even if the pro-Russian insurgents have themselves told that ”volunteering Russian soldiers on a leave” have been fighting among them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Corporate pruning pleases shareholders but fails to stimulate growth</seg>
<seg id="2">Are the chief executives of Australia's listed companies turning into a bunch of crowd-pleasers, bowing to shareholders' desire for higher dividends and to engage in share buybacks?</seg>
<seg id="3">Could it be that the balance of power has shifted from the boardrooms to the shareholders they serve?</seg>
<seg id="4">The evidence is clear from last week's close of the 2014 reporting season that dividends are king.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those companies that have rewarded investors with buybacks and bigger dividend payouts have had strongly performing share prices.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nothing wrong with that.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the flip side of this coin is that aggregate capital expenditure is declining at a greater rate than analysts have forecast - an outcome that leads one to wonder if there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and not enough on medium- and longer-term growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sure, some companies are returning money to their shareholders and financing their businesses by other means.</seg>
<seg id="9">For example, there is an increase in the amount of finance being obtained in the cheaper corporate bond market.</seg>
<seg id="10">From a company's perspective, this makes sense because debt, today, is historically cheap and equity is not.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, even if we back out the funds raised in debt markets it is clear that this generosity towards shareholders is primarily being financed by companies spending less on investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">The net result of this wave of buybacks (and the cancelling of dividend reinvestment programs) is that the number of equities in the Australian market is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Credit Suisse has called it the "de-equitising reporting season," in which companies are trying hard to keep their share numbers down.</seg>
<seg id="14">As part of the same theme, companies are raising less equity.</seg>
<seg id="15">The count from the reporting season is $3.7 billion worth of buybacks and $1.5 billion worth of expected equity raisings that did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Credit Suisse goes so far as to use the headline 'Capex is a dirty word' in one of its reports.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although we now have the numbers to support the fact that this trend is clear, the anecdotal evidence has been with us for months.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was sufficient for Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens to remark a few weeks ago that businesses needs a bit more "animal spirits" to push them into investment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stevens is not concerned about individual company's prospects but rather the aggregate impact on the economy because sluggish capital expenditure augurs badly for economic growth and employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Credit Suisse says: "Bottom-up capex estimates have come down by an average of 4 per cent over two years for reporting companies.</seg>
<seg id="21">Free cash-flow estimates have gone up by an average of 2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Improving cash flow is likely to fuel further de-equitisation.</seg>
<seg id="23">All this gives a snapshot that looks good for current shareholders and for the sharemarket, but it does suggest at least a hint of corporate expediency.</seg>
<seg id="24">Indeed, if I had $1 for every chief executive who remarked over the years that the short-term share price was not a concern then... well, you know the rest.</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, this statement is a nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="26">CEOs pay very close attention to their share price and are extremely concerned about fluctuations in it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their short-term and long-term bonus incentive packages are priced relative to the value of stock, and their tenure depends on it.</seg>
<seg id="28">What they really mean is that some corporate decisions (be they acquisitions, increased organic investment or dividend payments) are not always immediately popular but they are better for medium-term strategy.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indeed, corporate bosses regularly, and rightly, bemoan the fact that investment markets have a very short-term horizon.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is why this current bout of conservatism feels like a cave-in to short-term interests.</seg>
<seg id="31">For those that are assessing cheap debt markets and rationing equity, the concern does not apply, but it was all too clear in the reporting season just gone that there was a particular emphasis on rationing future capital expenditure and plenty of brownie points to be awarded for the tightest corporate wallets.</seg>
<seg id="32">The large miners like BHP and Rio Tinto led the charge in cutting capex, but there were plenty of others; some because they needed to, but others that were just mindful of their shareholders' response.</seg>
<seg id="33">So why are investors exerting so much pressure on companies to give them a dividend yield?</seg>
<seg id="34">Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik says the obvious answer is that the shareholders have become more income seeking, given falling returns from traditional fixed-income products as (perversely) central banks worldwide have lowered interest rates as they flood the market with liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thus investors have been pushed into the equity market in search of a return and, in turn, have applied pressure on companies to provide it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shareholders are also making it pretty clear to companies that they are nor prepared to fund what they consider risky investments, whose returns are uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="37">They would rather have the money in their wallets as they head, increasingly, towards retirement.</seg>
<seg id="38">The statistics from the latest reporting season clearly demonstrate that much of the earnings growth was the result of cost cutting, rather than revenue growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nude celebrity picture leak looks like phishing or email account hack</seg>
<seg id="2">The leak of pictures and, allegedly, videos of Jennifer Lawrence by an unknown hacker has security experts - and Apple - puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="3">Though the hacker has posted a list of scores of female celebrities to a chatroom claiming to have more pictures of them, a number of those named have come forward to say that photos claimed to be of them are faked, while others claim they were deleted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The list of those allegedly affected is long, and includes Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and the American actress Mary E Winstead.</seg>
<seg id="5">With any hack, the principal questions are: what was the avenue of attack?</seg>
<seg id="6">And where were the photos and videos - if they were real - downloaded from?</seg>
<seg id="7">The most headline-grabbing possibility for the source of the photos - a full-on frontal-assault ground-up hack of Apple's iCloud service - is also the least likely.</seg>
<seg id="8">Large companies like Apple have dedicated in-house security teams who attempt to break into their own systems regularly.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A wide scale "hack" of Apple's iCloud is unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even the original poster is not claiming that," noted Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro.</seg>
<seg id="11">As with the many celebrity hacks (and daily hacks that affect less famous people), the simpler and more likely explanation is the leak of an email and password combination, either through guesswork or "phishing," when users are fooled by authentic-looking sites into entering their login details, which are then used against them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Apple is still investigating what is claimed to be an attack on its iCloud service, which is used by iPhone users to store settings and, crucially, which backs up photos taken with the phone to "cloud" servers.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you have a user's email address and password for their iCloud service, you can log in to their account and download those photos and other details.</seg>
<seg id="14">The only block to that is if the account owner has enabled "two-factor authentication" (2FA) - an extra layer of security that will send a code to the owner's phone before it allows login.</seg>
<seg id="15">Comparatively few people use 2FA, however, either because they don't know about it or find it cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apple is still investigating whether the data was all taken from its iCloud service and, if so, to what extent users" accounts were compromised.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company had no statement at the time of publication.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ferguson suggests that the hacker may have used the "forgot password" link on Apple's iCloud system after gathering the celebrities" email addresses - perhaps from the address book of another hacked device.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alternatively, the stars used the same password on multiple services, which were captured through that.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lawrence's publicist says the photos are real, though not how old they are.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a tweet, Winstead suggested a longstanding effort by the hacker.</seg>
<seg id="22">Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this.</seg>
<seg id="23">Feeling for everyone who got hacked," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">However the independent security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that she had deleted the photos from her phone - but with modern smartphones, deleting a picture from the phone does not always mean that no copies exist.</seg>
<seg id="25">Modern smartphones routinely save photos to the cloud because they often lack enough capacity for the huge number of photos that people take.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apple's iPhone by default saves photos to iCloud; Google's Android to its Google+ service; Microsoft's Windows Phone to its OneDrive service.</seg>
<seg id="27">Third-party services such as Dropbox also offer automated photo and data backups.</seg>
<seg id="28">"People take photos and zap them, but don't realise that they are being uploaded," Cluley told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ferguson agrees: "Deleted doesn't always mean deleted," he notes.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those photos and videos can remain stored for years.</seg>
<seg id="31">If someone then gets hold of a user's email and password, they can re-download all the photos - and also any videos that might have been sent by email.</seg>
<seg id="32">For an Apple device, the photos can be downloaded on to a Mac or Windows PC, or any Apple device.</seg>
<seg id="33">The hacker posted a screenshot claiming to be of so-far unreleased videos and images taken on a Windows PC.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Two-factor authentication" protects against such hacks because it requires anyone setting up a copy of an existing account on a new device to enter a code that is sent to the primary device - usually a phone.</seg>
<seg id="35">Without that, access is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="36">Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all offer two-factor authentication on accounts, though it is not known how many, if any, of the affected celebrities used it.</seg>
<seg id="37">Others have claimed that pictures allegedly of them are not authentic.</seg>
<seg id="38">A representative for Ariana Grande said the photos said to be of her are "completely fake."</seg>
<seg id="39">Victoria Justice also tweeted that the "so called nudes of me are FAKE people.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let me nip this in the bud right now *pun intended*</seg>
<seg id="41">Cluley points to another possibility.</seg>
<seg id="42">Because those involved are celebrities, their accounts might have been hacked through someone who was handling their social media accounts or who regularly deals with their emails.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I wonder whether the agencies or some minion might be some part of this," he mused.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the stars named do not share a single publicist or management agency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Another possibility is that someone who set up one or more of the victims" systems, or helped configure one, secretly altered it so that any data would be passed back to them.</seg>
<seg id="46">That happened in the case of the "Hollywood hacker" Christopher Chaney, from Florida, who spread photos from Scarlettt Johansson and Mila Kunis's email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in jail in December 2012 and ordered to pay more than $66,000 in restitution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Chaney was accused of illegally accessing the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011; in one instance he sent an email from the account of Aguilera's stylist to the star, asking for scantily clad photos, and then posted them online.</seg>
<seg id="48">Afterwards Chaney apologised, saying that his actions were "probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience."</seg>
<seg id="49">It was also claimed he had stalked two people online for more than ten years.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cluley said: "In the Chaney case, the stars had their email accounts hacked, and they were being altered so that somebody kept being forwarded their data even when the password changed."</seg>
<seg id="51">He said that the obsessive behaviour of those who try to hack such accounts was like "butterfly collectors."</seg>
<seg id="52">They just like to collect this stuff.</seg>
<seg id="53">Perhaps what has happened here is that someone stumbled across a stash of these accounts and logins on somewhere like Dropbox.</seg>
<seg id="54">Or they have been at work for a long time to get at them.</seg>
<seg id="55">Or they hacked someone's email account and got at their address book, and then phished other people.</seg>
<seg id="56">My suspicion is that this isn't an iCloud security flaw as such.</seg>

<seg id="2">SCAMMERS are taking advantage of the carbon tax repeal and trying to steal your money, the ACCC warns.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer watchdog's SCAMwatch unit has issued a warning to consumers and businesses to be wary of too-good-to-be-true offers from people pretending to be from government agencies, offering thousands of dollars in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Scammers may take advantage of dollar figures being quoted in the media about how much consumers may save from changes in the price of goods following the carbon tax repeal, offering up to $7000, the warning states.</seg>
<seg id="5">They might sound convincing too, having already researched some of your personal details and using them to convince you to hand over your bank details or pay a fee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Scammers are using topical issues to dupe you.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's not just the carbon tax scammers are using to seize your cash, their schemes are growing more sophisticated, using topical issues and building their scams around them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired scammers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ACCC warns if you have any doubts about the identity of a caller claiming to represent a business, call the business back contacting them directly through your own search - don't rely on contact details supplied by the caller.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you receive a phone call or email out of the blue from someone claiming to be from a government department or business such as an energy provider and they claim that you are entitled to money due to the carbon tax repeal, be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="11">If you think you have been duped and may have given details or transferred money to a scammer, contact your financial institution immediately.</seg>
<seg id="12">And if the offer sounds too good to be true, like the government giving your free cash, it probably is.</seg>

<seg id="2">In an interview with Taloussanomat, the former prime minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions EU has imposed against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia’s focus in the politics is to pursue its own interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sanctions won’t necessarily affect this,” Lipponen says in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lipponen has started working as investigator for the businesses in Arctic regions in the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK).</seg>
<seg id="6">He’s worried, because the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended the project financing in Russia as part of the EU’s economical sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="7">”For example, it means that the environment projects for the northern dimension, which clearly have prospects, are going to be frozen,” Lipponen says in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="8">The freezing of the financing is going to obstruct the cooperation, the reconstruction of which might be difficult if there is no trust, Lipponen says.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he believes that the Finnish businesses’ interest in the Arctic Ocean cooperation projects will continue as strong as before.</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently he’s working on a report for EK about Finland’s policy with regards to Arctic and the business opportunities in the North.</seg>
<seg id="11">Acute situation in Ukraine or in Russia has no effect on that.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report looks far forward, we’re talking about dozens of years,” he says.</seg>

<seg id="2">Murdered SA man and pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pizza shop owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive toward both his partner and a security guard minutes before he was killed outside a city nightclub, a court has heard.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawyers for Mr Vallelonga's alleged killer today asked the Adelaide Magistrates Court to release their client on bail, saying it was "clear" he had acted in self-defence.</seg>
<seg id="5">Marie Shaw, QC, for the man - whose identity is suppressed - said the incident was insufficiently serious to warrant her client remaining behind bars until trial.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The evidence demonstrates the deceased was engaged in aggressive conduct to the point he had to be ejected from a nightclub," she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">After this there was an altercation resulting in one particular security guard having his shirt ripped ... by this drunken 40-year-old man.</seg>
<seg id="8">Importantly, when the prosecution says death resulted from one punch, this evidence raises fairly and squarely the question of self-defence or defence of another.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man, 25, has yet to plead to one count of murder.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious with serious head injuries near the corner of Rundle St and Synagogue Place about 2.25am on May 4.</seg>
<seg id="11">He died in Royal Adelaide Hospital, as a result of his injuries, early the next day - leaving friends and customers mourning the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.</seg>
<seg id="12">Prosecutors have alleged the alleged killer's actions were unprovoked and, after the incident, he told a taxi driver he had "put someone to sleep for a few days."</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, Ms Shaw said CCTV footage of the incident painted events in a different light.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It confirms aggressive behaviour by the deceased ... his partner was trying to placate him and was herself being dealt with roughly and harshly (by him)," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our client has not only the presumption of innocence but now a positive defence of self-defence that will be put (at trial).</seg>
<seg id="16">Prosecutors opposed the man's release, saying three security guards were present on the night of the incident and only one had complained about Mr Vallelonga.</seg>
<seg id="17">They said the other guards were unconcerned about him as he was "short," and wrote off his verbal abuse as that of "a 100m hero" who did not want a physical confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="18">They said a taxi driver would give evidence that, based on his "unobstructed" view of the incident, Mr Vallelonga was punched "forcefully" and had no chance to defend himself.</seg>
<seg id="19">Magistrate Elizabeth Sheppard remanded the man in custody until next week, when she will announce her decision.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bad weather was expected to delay the beginning of the hunt which has been widely condemned globally.</seg>
<seg id="3">The annual dolphin hunt season started again on Monday in the Japanese city Taiji.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected to last until the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="5">British newspaper The Guardian, among others, tells about the hunt which has been largely opposed around the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the hunt, the hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote cove, and after the most suitable ones have been selected to be taken to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world, the mammals will be slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dolphin meat will end up also in the food production.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="9">The practice became known globally in 2009, when “The Cove”, a documentary film about the hunt was released.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticised by animal rights activists, and also by diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the protesters, the dolphin meat has in any case limited markets due to its high mercury concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the promoters, including Japan’s government, the hunt is a tradition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The supporters have also reminded that the dolphins aren’t endangered.</seg>
<seg id="14">Demonstrations against the dolphin hunt were organised in several countries already over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the protesters in Tokyo, the hunt damages Japan’s reputation around the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also in Helsinki there was a demonstration in front of Japan’s embassy on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="2">There are divergent opinions within military alliance Nato on whether Nato bases should be created in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics, as a response to Ukraine crisis, newspaper Financial Times reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Poland and Estonia have requested the military alliance to bring troops to their countries permanently, but Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been against the plan.</seg>
<seg id="4">“What Ukraine has done is put a new perspective Russia’s policy, and it is threatening to overturn the European security,” Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute in London said to Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nato members will meet next week, and the military alliance’s objective is to release its new readiness action plan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The key issue of the plan is whether Nato can breach the CFE Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces, which was signed in 1990.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the treaty Nato and Warsaw Pact agreed on how to position armed forces in the territory between Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the Financial Times, the treaty prevents in practice new military bases in the eastern Europe and in the Baltics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Russia itself declared a moratorium on the treaty in 2007, but the country didn’t actually dissociate itself from it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, Nato is pondering whether the treaty terms still need to be abided by.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt Guthmiller becomes youngest teen to fly around the world</seg>
<seg id="2">At a time when most teens are starting to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 19-year-old recently became the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the globe, and he did it alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The South Dakota teenager flew 30,000 miles, making 23 stops in 15 countries on five continents.</seg>
<seg id="5">Along the way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star for his record-breaking flight.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also heard what the critics had to say.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It's too risky" or "This is some spoiled, rich brat going out and having a good time."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he didn't have much to say to his critics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was certainly a lot of fun and I had a good time, but it was a lot of work and I hope that what I did inspires other people to go out and do big things.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was inspired to pilot a plane at an early age, first asking his parents to eat at airport cafes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Later he pushed for flying lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">They agreed to let me do this little $20, 20-minute intro flight, but I think they probably thought that was going to be the end of that.</seg>
<seg id="13">It wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="14">He soon made a deal to get more time in the cockpit.</seg>
<seg id="15">A little arrangement where I would share a car with my dad throughout high school instead of having my own car.</seg>
<seg id="16">In exchange, I got to fly planes.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the age of 17, he had his pilot's license and two years later leased a single-engine Beechcraft for his solo flight around the world.</seg>
<seg id="18">The MIT student performed plane maintenance and his own fuel calculations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Long hours in the air meant some additional fuel for him as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">Basically, a lot of caffeine and Oreos.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said he went through a few rows of Oreos during one of the long legs of his flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Flying into the clouds was both beautiful and dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="23">Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have the weather radar to help him navigate around thunderstorms.</seg>
<seg id="24">I have no idea which clouds were just a little bit higher than where I'm at and which ones go up to 45,000 feet and will break the plane apart.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was flying a plane that was not pressurized and didn't have oxygen, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="26">And with a bunch of fuel it's hard to get up any higher.</seg>
<seg id="27">One day after our interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after crashing his plane on what Guthmiller called the most difficult leg of his own journey -- American Samoa to Hawaii.</seg>
<seg id="28">Guthmiller flew from the same airstrip as Suleman and said the take-off is technically challenging because of the heavy fuel load needed for the 16-hour stretch.</seg>
<seg id="29">In spite of the risks and even a fear of heights, Guthmiller succeeded in breaking the record and raising money for computer science education through Code.org.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is a coder himself, who started his own tech company at the age of 12.</seg>
<seg id="31">His goals are more than sky high.</seg>
<seg id="32">I think it would be really cool to start the next Apple, but we'll see how that goes.</seg>
<seg id="33">He said he is aiming high.</seg>
<seg id="34">Shoot for the stars, you can get somewhere good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Finding the right franchisee is more difficult than you think</seg>
<seg id="2">When a reality show about her business called The Cupcake Girls aired on the W Network in 2009, Lori Joyce was thrilled to find fans lining up at Cupcakes by Heather and Lori locations across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is until she found out that one franchisee wasn't up to the task.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There was a franchisee sitting in her car calling me because she has 100 potential customers lined up ready to buy a cupcake, and she couldn't handle it," said Ms. Joyce.</seg>
<seg id="5">That was a really big eye opener for me, because it was a really big missed opportunity for us.</seg>
<seg id="6">After that incident Ms. Joyce decided to change her franchise partner screening process, switching her focus from finding talented bakers to finding talented leaders that emanate the company's culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everyone can do a good interview... they know what I want to hear," she said, adding that she's conducted approximately 100 for each of her 11 franchise locations.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have six weeks of training, but they behave completely differently once they're in their environment, so it's really tricky, and as a result my training really heavily emphasizes cultural fit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Finding the right franchisee is vital for the development of any small businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">While a strong and honest leader can help shape and grow the organization, a poor fit can do costly damage to an established company.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I used to think looking for a franchisee was like dating, but it's not like that at all, because when you date you can do a whole lot to get to know each other before you get married," said Ms. Joyce.</seg>
<seg id="12">But with franchising you literally sign a franchise agreement, receive a deposit and build out a store.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's a significant jump and a major test of trust entering that partnership with someone before seeing them perform.</seg>
<seg id="14">Like a strong marriage, franchisors and franchisees need to enter a symbiotic relationship built on common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association.</seg>
<seg id="15">She therefore believes that it's just as important for the franchisee to vet their prospective franchisor before entering such a long-term relationship.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Just as its true in a personal relationship, if they're rude to you when you're dating, can you imagine what they'll be like when you're married?" she said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's equally as important for both parties to be vetting, evaluating, and paying attention to any warning flags they get from either side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ms. McLachlan adds that franchisors like Ms. Joyce can take what they've learned from the successes and failures of past partnerships, but first-time franchisors need to be more diligent in taking on those vital first partners.</seg>
<seg id="19">New franchisors instead need to take the lessons of their presumably successful corporate location to determine what challenges they've had to overcome, and what skill sets franchisees will require when facing similar obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="20">First time franchisers can also work with a franchise consultant to devise a profile based on industry norms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms. McLachlan adds that there are a variety of resources for first-time franchisors and franchisees available on the CFA's website, lookforafranchise.ca.</seg>
<seg id="22">The process gets easier over time, however, not only because franchisors become better practiced at vetting potential franchisees, but because their first few franchisors can act as an advisory board moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The first franchise partner was very instrumental in helping Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1800-GOT-JUNK?) build the business and the franchise system," said Erik Church, COO of O2E Brands, which include 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me, and Wow 1 Day Painting.</seg>
<seg id="24">They helped create something that Brain couldn't have created on his own, so if you're looking for your first franchise partners, think of them that way.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Church oversees 216 franchises across O2E's three brands, and is also the Toronto franchise partner of You Move Me.</seg>
<seg id="26">When it comes to finding the right franchise partner, Mr. Church uses a very straightforward method.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The one litmus test that's held true for us is, "would I want to invite this person over to my house for a barbecue over the weekend?"" he said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"If the answer is "no" to that, chances are you're not going to want to spend a lot of time with them during the day working through challenging business problems."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Church adds that much of the O2E Brands" success has resulted from its franchise structure.</seg>
<seg id="30">While managers in a corporate structure might see their position as short term and their relationship with superiors as highly formalized, franchisees buy into the business with a longer-term focus, and are therefore more vested in the success of the business.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There are so many more upsides to having a franchise partner than having a corporate setup, but with that comes a more intensive relationship," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's not a relationship between a VP and an operations manager, it's a partnership.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a much more difficult relationship, but it bares much more fruit when managed well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rail delays knock north US grain prices</seg>
<seg id="2">Protracted rail shipping delays have led to deep discounts for grain prices in the north central US, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new stress.</seg>
<seg id="3">Commercial silos in North Dakota are offering farmers only $2.70 a bushel for corn - about $1 less than benchmark prices - due mainly to the costs of securing capacity on adjacent tracks, traders and agricultural groups said.</seg>
<seg id="4">IN Commodities</seg>
<seg id="5">Problems are most acute on the BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and Canadian Pacific railroads.</seg>
<seg id="6">A federal railroad regulator will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Far from river barge networks, northern plains states rely heavily on railroads to move agricultural commodities.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rail delays lengthened after a bumper 2013 crop was followed by an extremely cold winter that slowed and shortened trains.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some farmers suspect railroads" rising shipments of crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale formation have sidetracked grain, a contention railroads dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="10">For traders storing and moving grain, the premium to secure a "shuttle train" has risen from zero to $2,000-$3,000 per car per year, an executive at an international grain trading house said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Somebody's going to pay the cost.</seg>
<seg id="12">"You're either going to get it from the farmer or from your customer," the executive said.</seg>
<seg id="13">This year North Dakota's soyabean harvest is projected to expand more than a third, while its spring wheat crop will be 16 per cent bigger, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.</seg>
<seg id="14">Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, said: "Normally we try to start the harvest caught up, in terms of having available storage cleaned out and farmers" grain sold and moved.</seg>
<seg id="15">But we're starting from behind this year because of the service disruptions that occurred last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">BNSF has reassured customers and regulators it should handle this year's harvest smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="17">John Miller, BNSF's vice-president for agriculture, said the company had reduced its backlog of overdue movements - orders from customers for railcars that have taken more than four days to fulfil - from a peak of 16,500 in early April to 2,000.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We've moved almost all the old crop that wanted to move with us," Mr Miller said, referring to grain left over from the previous harvest.</seg>
<seg id="19">The most recent reported speeds for BNSF's grain trains, however, were still 9 per cent down on last year's second quarter - an indication of congestion.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Miller accepted that progress had been "uneven" but pointed out that the company was in the course of making $5bn capital investments this year to increase capacity to handle surging traffic of all kinds, including grain.</seg>
<seg id="21">Train speeds on Canadian Pacific, the other railroad suffering serious problems because of the backlog, are down 11 per cent on the same period last year but sharply up on far lower speeds earlier in the year.</seg>
<seg id="22">CP has told the Surface Transportation Board, the railroad regulator, that changes in its ordering system for railcars should boost its ability to handle traffic in the coming harvest by 15 to 20 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="23">"CP's operating plan going into the fall is focused on ongoing improvement in the velocity of our trains and effective utilisation of our railcar fleet in order to deliver more cars each week," said a spokeswoman.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukraine crisis may solve NATO's 'identity crisis'</seg>
<seg id="2">World leaders, diplomats and experts have often fretted about the future of NATO and whether the end of its mission in Afghanistan would also be the end of its relevance.</seg>
<seg id="3">But as 60 leaders, including President Obama, converge on Cardiff, Wales, this week for a NATO summit, the uncertainty seems more than a little premature.</seg>
<seg id="4">The politicians and diplomats have no shortage of world crises crowding their agenda, so many that the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, once a top priority, has slipped down the list of most pressing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the 28-nation alliance is being called upon to counter Russia's renewed incursion in Ukraine, a jolting reminder that threats to sovereignty in Europe are not necessarily a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the leaders will be looking for new ways to punish Russia, they'll also be repositioning troops, pledging more money for military spending and recommitting to collective defense.</seg>
<seg id="7">In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It was really searching for its purpose ... and it was having a fairly significant identity crisis," said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it has now not only been repurposed, it's been reinvigorated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Obama has also added another task to the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="11">The president says he will try to corral leaders to work toward a strategy to defeat the rapidly rising Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.</seg>
<seg id="12">The president faces considerable challenges in rallying his war-weary allies to sign on to a military response, particularly one that crosses the border from Iraq into Syria, officials acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the president, who inartfully declared "we have no strategy" for defeating the extremists, is under pressure to show he is leading the world toward finding one.</seg>
<seg id="14">Western officials have set modest expectations for breakthroughs on either Ukraine or Islamic State discussions at the summit.</seg>
<seg id="15">The chief punishment in the pipeline for what Ukraine labeled a Russian invasion is additional economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="16">European Union officials took up the issue over the weekend, but put off a decision on any new penalties.</seg>
<seg id="17">And U.S. officials noted that Obama's key targets for cooperation on Islamic State were not necessarily NATO members.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lineup of concerns could not have been anticipated two years ago, when the last North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit was held in Chicago and dominated by talk of the Afghanistan drawdown.</seg>
<seg id="19">A year before that, then-Pentagon chief Robert M. Gates used his last speech in office to describe the organization as on the verge of "collective military irrelevance."</seg>
<seg id="20">U.S. officials persistently complained of other nations falling short of their funding targets.</seg>
<seg id="21">NATO members agree to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, but only four countries - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States - met that benchmark last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">But White House officials now say they sense a shift.</seg>
<seg id="23">NATO members are expected to sign a pledge in Cardiff agreeing to increase spending in support of the collective defense agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">The details were still under discussion late last week, but the White House noted momentum behind the effort as member nations seemed to see the threats facing them in starker terms.</seg>
<seg id="25">In light of the Russian intrusion in Ukraine, the treaty's "defense guarantees are more salient today, more urgent today than they've been at any time since the end of the Cold War," said Charles Kupchan, senior director for Europe at the National Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are reasonably optimistic that we will get agreement among the 28 allies.</seg>
<seg id="27">Obama will spend much of his trip reiterating that commitment to collective defense for the benefit of Russia's anxious neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="28">The president will begin his three-day trip with a daylong stop in Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet with leaders of that country as well as of Latvia and Lithuania.</seg>
<seg id="29">Estonia has seen a rotation of U.S. NATO troops on its soil since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula this year, and it's bound to get a steady stream of NATO troops under a new Readiness Action Plan set to be announced this week.</seg>
<seg id="30">The plan aims to shorten the time for NATO forces to respond to aggression on the frontline states, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will come with increased air policing and other visible signs of alliance protection.</seg>
<seg id="32">The move comes with some risk for NATO, which abstained from putting permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe, a gesture of comity toward Russia.</seg>
<seg id="33">Officials say the new plan does not technically breach that agreement, but it may only be a semantic difference, said one Western diplomat, who would not be named discussing the plans before the formal announcement.</seg>
<seg id="34">The word likely to be used to describe the NATO presence is "persistent," the diplomat said, rather than "permanent."</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin’s effective ”winter weapon” – will he use it on Ukraine?</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has an ace up his sleeve when it comes to Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="3">The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Mr. Putin of providing arms to the insurgents and sending Russian troops to Ukraine’s territory.</seg>
<seg id="4">For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the situation in Ukraine has tensed up, the West is planning to impose harder sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Russia holds a trump card: winter is on its way, and Ukraine’s main source for energy is Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to an American authority, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), Geysar Gurbanov, active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.</seg>
<seg id="8">With winter coming to Ukraine in the next under four months, and the coal mines located in the eastern part of the country ravaged by conflict, Ukrainians will freeze in their homes as their gas supplies from Russia are depleted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia’s energy giant, will help Mr. Putin to win the war eventually, Gurbanov writes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last year, half of the gas consumed in Ukraine came from Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">On July 16th, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid bills.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier this month, Gazprom said that Ukraine's outstanding debt for gas supplies stood at 5.3 billion dollars (approximately 4 billion euros) as of August 1st.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the New York Times Mr. Putin commented the upcoming winter with the following words:</seg>
<seg id="14">I think that nobody thinks of [winter] any more, except Russia, Mr. Putin said.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are always ways of helping resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="16">First, to immediately stop hostilities, and start restoring the necessary infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="17">To start replenishing reserves, the necessary repair operations must be conducted and the preparations for the cold season must be made.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Business Insider, Mr. Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a veiled threat.</seg>
<seg id="19">If Ukraine's army won't back down against the separatists, then Moscow might use natural gas as a weapon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alistair Newman of Japanese holding company Nomura noted last month that Russia's arguments for humanitarian intervention and the potential for engineering a fresh natural gas crisis in Ukraine will become stronger in a few months, if Russia can sustain the separatist militias' operations until then.</seg>
<seg id="21">A note from Moscow has already arrived, saying that Ukraine must prepay for future gas shipments, unless Kiev begins payments on accumulated debts.</seg>
<seg id="22">The EU is currently trying to negotiate a deal that would allow gas shipments to resume temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said last week that Russia is planning to suspend the gas shipments to the EU countries in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="24">Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said later that the rumours are unfounded.</seg>
<seg id="25">He says Russia is doing every possible thing, so that gas can be supplied to EU countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">A childhood experience of Riku Rantala of ”Madventures” in Afghanistan: ”It was a truly changing human encounter”</seg>
<seg id="2">Madventures released today a new book called "Global Explanation – the Adventurer’s Explanation to Everything”.</seg>
<seg id="3">We asked Riku Rantala an explanation for example for the future of the world and for the differences between Indian and Finnish cultures.</seg>
<seg id="4">Riku also tells about the most significant human encounter of his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Riku Rantala, an author, a journalist, the other half of Madventures, is a busy man.</seg>
<seg id="6">A new book has been released today, there was a film picnic at the Kansalaistori yesterday, and the second season of “Docventures” starts on Yle on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has been running from one place to another since the morning.</seg>
<seg id="8">After MTV morning show taking his child to the nursery school, and from there heading to a weekly meeting.</seg>
<seg id="9">This interview was supposed to be made face-to-face, but it had to be changed into a telephone interview.</seg>
<seg id="10">Otherwise there’s no time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Amidst all the rush he and Tunna Milonoff, the other half of Madventures, have had time to stop and write the book ”Global explanation” which, according to the cover text, is an adventurer’s handbook to everything.</seg>
<seg id="12">To everything, right?</seg>
<seg id="13">Wow, that’s a lot to promise.</seg>
<seg id="14">The book reflects on several themes, such as what is our future like, why a certain culture succeeds less than another, why we are here and who we really are.</seg>
<seg id="15">We took advantage of the interviews we had done over the years.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the book, there are both professors and artists as experts.</seg>
<seg id="17">We were working on the book actively for about a year, Riku tells over the phone to IS.</seg>
<seg id="18">You have bit quite a big chunk to chew in the book.</seg>
<seg id="19">What’s the key message of the book?</seg>
<seg id="20">The message is that you must know more about the world, and that the big questions are worth contemplating, because that’s the best way for us to make it in this world.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the idea of the book is to be a good travel read, but it is meant to also make people discuss and share their thoughts at home as well.</seg>
<seg id="22">The discussion can even lead to actions, Riku tells.</seg>
<seg id="23">PHOTO: Pete Aarre-Ahtio</seg>
<seg id="24">One of the book’s topics is the future of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">How does it look like?</seg>
<seg id="26">We made a conclusion that the human race is optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite the climate warming and Earth’s present condition, you have to believe that at some point we will make solutions in order to improve our situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Earth is like an alcoholic.</seg>
<seg id="29">First it should admit that we have a problem, the change can take place only after that, Riku philosophises.</seg>
<seg id="30">Riku tells that according to some studies the western humanity has reached the climax of the happiness in 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="31">After that getting wealthier hasn’t increased our happiness.</seg>
<seg id="32">From this we can deduce that when you have enough money and our basic needs are met, we’re happy.</seg>
<seg id="33">Money doesn’t increase happiness.</seg>
<seg id="34">In fact we want to instigate people to discuss about what is enough.</seg>
<seg id="35">Exploitation of our natural resources doesn’t suffice for long if things continue like this, Riku notes.</seg>
<seg id="36">You also discuss cultural differences in the book.</seg>
<seg id="37">How an Indian person differs from a Finnish one?</seg>
<seg id="38">People aren’t particularly different.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the starting points are different when it comes to education, health care and hygiene, for example.</seg>
<seg id="40">Culturally the biggest difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India, in a good and a bad sense.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the West has gotten wealthier, more people are living alone.</seg>
<seg id="42">You isolate yourself from others, and that may lead to loneliness and distress.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we could find the right balance between community and being alone, we would be quite close to happiness, Riku tells.</seg>
<seg id="44">Riku has met lots of different people around the world.</seg>
<seg id="45">Which human encounter has left the biggest imprint in his mind?</seg>
<seg id="46">It happened when I was a child, when I was on my first longer trip abroad with my family.</seg>
<seg id="47">We lived one year in India and in Pakistan, as my father was working there for the UN.</seg>
<seg id="48">I was 7 years old, and my two younger siblings were there too.</seg>
<seg id="49">My brother was just a baby, Riku describes.</seg>
<seg id="50">We returned home carried by a big moving truck.</seg>
<seg id="51">We were driving in Afghanistan, which was ravaged by war, and on the sides of the road there was a vast amount of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">A girl of my age was walking on the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="53">I was sitting on the seat of a big Mercedes with a can of Coke in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="54">Our eyes met, Riku describes.</seg>
<seg id="55">Also a child of that age gets the situation.</seg>
<seg id="56">It was one truly changing human encounter, which I will remember always.</seg>
<seg id="57">PHOTO: Leena Koskela</seg>
<seg id="58">Riku and Tunna at a book fair in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="59">At that moment Riku ”twigged” that other people must be respected, even if they were significantly poorer, or even if they hadn’t the same preconditions in life as we do.</seg>
<seg id="60">Riku grasped already at that time that money can’t be the measure of the value of a human being.</seg>
<seg id="61">Among the adulthood memories, the people he has met in New Guinea stand out.</seg>
<seg id="62">I couldn’t stop marvelling how traditionally people live there.</seg>
<seg id="63">They avail themselves of the natural materials in everything, they barely use money or metallic tools.</seg>
<seg id="64">They live in very challenging conditions.</seg>
<seg id="65">Surviving is really hard.</seg>
<seg id="66">It made me think.</seg>
<seg id="67">And along the book he and Tunna want to make the people think as well.</seg>
<seg id="68">We want the book to inspire people to read, watch and listen more.</seg>
<seg id="69">That it would make people act, from warm lovemaking to a discussion, and even to a fist fight, Riku shoots.</seg>

<seg id="2">The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also the United States is tightening its own sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a political need for the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would be impossible that the EU and the US wouldn’t react, when Russia makes war in Ukraine and has invaded Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="6">In international politics, an act is followed by a reaction, and actions are followed by counteractions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Experience shows that all sanctions only have an effect in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="8">Iran was persuaded to talks with regards to its nuclear program after years only.</seg>
<seg id="9">The apartheid government of South-Africa sat glued to its chairs, even when trade was banned with UN resolutions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanctions have been used against Russia, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the Cold War, exporting high-end electronics or military technology to the Soviet Union wasn’t allowed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russia itself has set obstacles for trade for ages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The latest was when trade of raw timber was being frozen by timber duties.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is clear that you can’t get Russia on its knees with sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Russians are accustomed to bad times, and Viola disappearing from the shops doesn’t create panic.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the EU says it’s going to ban importing vodka from Russia, it’s basically a joke.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Russians will be glad to drink that vodka themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The EU sanctions are also selective.</seg>
<seg id="19">The French can export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland can’t export milk.</seg>
<seg id="20">The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.</seg>
<seg id="21">The biggest damage to Russia is not the petering out of the cheese import or the vodka export.</seg>
<seg id="22">The biggest damage is caused by the restriction of the financial sector.</seg>
<seg id="23">They’ll have an impact in the future only.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Russian state will not be able to operate in the international lending markets.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has to make payments of the old loans, but obtaining new ones is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Russia has enormous foreign exchange reserves, they won’t last forever either.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Russian businesses’ access to credit will wane, and money becomes more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="28">Their own banks will not be able to finance all of them.</seg>
<seg id="29">More money needs to be printed, or the businesses will have payment difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="30">The bankruptcies are bankruptcies in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tony Popovic will be without three key players in Korea.</seg>
<seg id="3">WITH several key members of his squad suspended for the first leg, Western Sydney Wanderers coach Tony Popovic says he won't be afraid to throw any of his players into the Asian Champions League cauldron at FC Seoul.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Wanderers are in Dubai for a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly games in Abu Dhabi, to prepare for their semi-final first leg on September 17.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to an accumulation of yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole will all miss the trip to Korea, but Wanderers coach Popovic has faith in their replacements.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Of course it is a loss - they've been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tomi Juric got banned for this gesture in China.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a blow, you don't want to miss any of your players, but we missed Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game and up until now we've had Daniel Mullen injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whoever comes in has done a great job and I've got full faith in the whole squad.</seg>
<seg id="10">I won't be afraid to play anyone in that semi-final.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Wanderers will also be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Socceroos defender picked up the injury during pre-season but has resumed running and is a chance of playing in the return leg at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's on track, so he's progressing well," Popovic said.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has his own program that he's filling and will be coming with us to Dubai, which is great news for him that he's starting to slowly get out on the field.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's had a couple of sessions outside, which is good.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's still a while away for us before he's fully fit, but he's progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the Wanderers are in Dubai they will be making use of the world-class facilities on offer at the exclusive Al Sheba Sports Complex.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Popovic says the trip is also an opportunity for his squad, which has changed significantly since the end of last season, to get to know each other better.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We know that this will certainly help the players bond together as well," Popovic said.</seg>
<seg id="20">We've got a lot of new players and it will be a great opportunity for them to get know each other even better on and off the field.</seg>
<seg id="21">So we'll use that camp for various reasons.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sep 01, 2014, 9:18 pm In North Korea, the luxury of the rich households can be enjoyed, if you happen to belong to country’s elite.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial Times tells about the economy torn by contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The informal markets thrive in North Korea, perhaps more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="5">They offer to the wealthy, or to the thrifty ordinary citizens luxury, which usually isn’t connected to a dictatorial regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: only the entry fee to this recreation park is up to ten times as much as an ordinary worker’s monthly wage.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the park you can eat hamburgers which cost 76 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="8">That’s a 3-5 months wage for an ordinary working man in the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Men are drinking beer in shorts at the pool.</seg>
<seg id="10">Life looks expensive and nice.</seg>
<seg id="11">North Korea’s ”western markets” have their origin in the 1990s, when the country was suffering famine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ormiston House: Stormont Assembly hopeful of sale</seg>
<seg id="2">The Stormont Assembly is hopeful it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that was costing the taxpayer almost £3,000 a week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The assembly bought the 19th Century property in the east of the city 13 years ago for £9m.</seg>
<seg id="4">While it remained unsold, it cost the assembly an estimated £400 a day on security and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was recently advertised at £1.25m.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is understood the property will be used as a private residence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grade B listed building was bought for £9m in 2001 to provide extra office accommodation for the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was later deemed unfit for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ten years after it was bought, the property was put on the market with an asking price of £2.5m.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not sold and the price was dropped.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt suggested Ormiston House might provide a venue for a new international trauma centre.</seg>
<seg id="12">But now the assembly has confirmed it is working to agree the sale of the property.</seg>
<seg id="13">A spokesperson said a new owner would take possession of the site when legal work was concluded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Neither the assembly nor the estate agent involved would comment on the identity of the buyer or the purchase price.</seg>
<seg id="15">The average weekly bill for security and repairs at Ormiston House is around £3,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">The assembly bought the property from the Police Authority, the predecessor of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the start of this year, security costs at Ormiston had come to £885,641, while maintenance and running costs added up to £371,379.</seg>
<seg id="18">Professional fees relating to repairs and maintenance added another £250,015 to the total bill, while a further £212,466 was spent on professional fees for development and planning.</seg>
<seg id="19">The property was previously owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland who remained there until 1887, when it was acquired by his business partner William Pirrie, who later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff came into sole ownership of the property, selling it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1">”Inequality is increasing”: Helsinki to reduce education assistants</seg>
<seg id="2">Savings aren’t being created, claims the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors JHL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the amount of school specific education assistants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The reduction wouldn’t concern children’s personal assistants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Education and Training Committee of Helsinki ended up proposing a cut of approximately 2.7 million in total to the resources of education assistants.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are approximately 600 education assistants in total in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the reductions will take place, they will be come into effect in the middle of the term, starting from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to JHL the decision will increase inequality.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are more and more children in need of support for learning.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it is unfortunately very easy to reduce assistants for saving reasons, because it hasn’t been defined clearly in the legislation how much support should be given.</seg>
<seg id="11">There surely will not be any saving. On the contrary, the burden of the teaching personnel will increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the pupils it produces a greater risk to miss the learning goals, and also the teachers’ strength will be tried, stresses Päivi Niemi-Laine, the domain director of JHL.</seg>
<seg id="13">The plans of the city of Helsinki will produce inequality to schools, because with the future resources, small schools and the pupils in need of support will not get any assistant resources any more.</seg>
<seg id="14">The goal of the city of Helsinki is inequality prevention.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is exactly the educational assistants, who currently are doing the preventive work with results.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the adaptive measures of the Education Department target mainly this group.</seg>
<seg id="17">All parties will suffer from this in the future.</seg>
<seg id="18">The final resolution regarding the resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, to whom I wish insight and wisdom in looking far in the future and in acting up to its goals, Niemi-Laine says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israel claims land in West Bank</seg>
<seg id="2">Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement known as "Gevaot," in the Etzion settlement bloc, near Bethlehem.</seg>
<seg id="3">Israel laid claim on Sunday to nearly 400 hectares (1000 acres) of West Bank land in a Jewish settlement bloc near Bethlehem - a step that could herald significant Israeli construction in the area - defying Palestinian demands for a halt in settlement expansion and challenging world opinion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes the construction of settlements in the West Bank, said that the action on Sunday might be the largest single appropriation of West Bank land in decades and that it could "dramatically change the reality" in the area.</seg>
<seg id="5">Palestinians aspire to form a state in the lands that Israel conquered in 1967.</seg>
<seg id="6">Israeli officials said the political directive to expedite a survey of the status of the land came after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in June while hitchhiking in that area.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the prime mover in the kidnapping and killing of the teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The timing of the land appropriation suggested that it was meant as a kind of compensation for the settlers and punishment for the Palestinians.</seg>
<seg id="9">The land, which is near the Jewish settlement of Gvaot in the Etzion bloc south of Jerusalem, has now officially been declared "state land," as opposed to land privately owned by Palestinians, clearing the way for the potential approval of Israeli building plans there.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the mayor of the nearby Palestinian town of Surif, Ahmad Lafi, said the land belonged to Palestinian families.</seg>
<seg id="11">He told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA that Israeli army forces and personnel posted orders early on Sunday announcing the seizure of land that was planted with olive and forest trees in Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interested parties have 45 days in which to register objections.</seg>
<seg id="13">The kidnapping of the teenagers prompted an Israeli military clampdown in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamic group that dominates Gaza and that Israel said was behind the abductions.</seg>
<seg id="14">The subsequent tensions along the Israel-Gaza border erupted into a 50-day war that ended last week with an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">The land appropriation has quickly turned attention back to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and exposed the contradictory visions in the Israeli government that hamper the prospects of any broader Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lapland’s crisis municipalities usually multi-problematic</seg>
<seg id="2">Increasingly greater part of Lapland’s municipalities has problems, as emerges from a wellbeing research made by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are no quick solutions to crisis municipalities’ problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">Professor says reducing municipalities’ tasks by one billion euros isn’t enough.</seg>
<seg id="5">Common elements among the crisis municipalities are for example weak municipality economy, weak employment and relocation losses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Asko Suikkanen, professor emeritus of sociology in the University of Lapland, says there are new crisis municipalities coming from the western border and eastern Lapland.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the survey part of the research, the inhabitants were assessing the situation of their municipality in a quite realistic way.</seg>
<seg id="8">The inhabitants of the municipalities which did well in the research even had a pessimistic view of the prospects.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unenthusiastic expectations affect the consumption.</seg>
<seg id="10">People wish that the current everyday life and wellbeing would continue and that they maybe would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="11">In these times people are afraid to make long time investments, such as buying a house, says Suikkanen.</seg>
<seg id="12">The research group was surprised by the big differences between the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, the income support expenses per inhabitant range from something like twenty euros to well over hundred euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax revenue gained by the municipality per inhabitant range from a good two thousand euros of Ranua to Pelkosenniemi’s 4,400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Suikkanen the municipalities of Lapland are different.</seg>
<seg id="16">How the money is spent, how much state subsidies are being received and what is the level of the indebtedness, differ a lot between municipalities which are in similar situations, he says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bob Carr welcomes the imminent release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a Libyan jail</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan jail today.</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal government has welcomed news Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor later today.</seg>
<seg id="4">A spokesman for Foreign Minister Bob Carr said "all going well" the International Criminal Court lawyer will be released into the custody of Australian officials tonight and will board a plane bound for Europe by midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We welcome the news that she is likely to be released today," the spokesman told AAP from New York.</seg>
<seg id="6">We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ms Taylor is likely to be taken to Rome before her onward journey to her home in The Hague.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms Taylor, along with three of her ICC colleagues, was detained in the Libyan city of Zintan on June 7 while representing Seif al-Islam, the son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.</seg>
<seg id="10">Libyan officials said she was found carrying documents for Seif that were judged a threat to national security.</seg>
<seg id="11">Senator Carr has lobbied hard for her release, even visiting the Libyan capital Tripoli last month to press her case.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms Taylor was not able to speak to her husband and young daughter until last week.</seg>
<seg id="13">Senator Carr said Ms Taylor was permitted to call her home in The Hague shortly after a visit by Australia's ambassador David Ritchie.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Carr subsequently spoke to Ms Taylor's Brisbane-based parents John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear she was finally allowed a phone call.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her parents had pleaded with Libya to release their daughter in time for her toddler's third birthday in July.</seg>
<seg id="16">The three other detained ICC staffers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Carr said a week ago that talks in The Hague between the ICC and the Libyan authorities had resulted in "the ICC expressing regret, effectively an apology for any misunderstandings."</seg>
<seg id="18">The ICC has stopped short of admitting to any wrongdoing but has said it will fully investigate its team's behaviour upon their return.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When the ICC has completed its investigation, the Court will ensure that anyone found responsible for any misconduct will be subject to appropriate sanctions," it added in a statement issued last month.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ICC wants to try Seif al-Islam, 39, for crimes against humanity during his father's rule, which came to an abrupt end last year.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tripoli insists he should be tried locally and filed on May 1 a motion challenging the ICC's jurisdiction to put him on trial in The Hague.</seg>

<seg id="1">After reaching $433,000, donations for Ferguson cop halt mysteriously</seg>
<seg id="2">After raising more than $400,000 for the police officer who killed an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Mo., two online donation pages appear to have been shut down by their organizers without explanation this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the crowdsourced fundraising site GoFundMe, "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" -- two separate pages with similar names -- have raised $235,750 and $197,620, respectively, for the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">A similar page for Brown's family, run by the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, had raised $314,099 as of Sunday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shooting triggered weeks of unrest and demonstrations against the overwhelmingly white police force in mostly black Ferguson, sending Wilson into hiding as local and federal investigations seek to determine whether he wrongfully killed Brown.</seg>
<seg id="6">The online donation campaigns have generated some controversy for defending Wilson, especially after some visitors left racially offensive remarks in at least one of the comment sections, which have since been removed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both pages appear to have stopped taking donations around the same time on Saturday, and the pages' organizers did not explain why.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a visitor attempts to donate, a message appears that says: "Donations are Complete!</seg>
<seg id="9">The organizer has stopped donations.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe said the website had not halted the donations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Each and every GoFundMe campaign organizer is able to decide for themselves when they would like to stop accepting donations," said the statement from GoFundMe spokeswoman Kelsea Little.</seg>
<seg id="12">Organizers may also choose to begin accepting donations again at a later date.</seg>
<seg id="13">The page "Support Officer Wilson," which raised $197,620, is run by a St. Louis police charity called "Shield of Hope," which has been certified by GoFundMe as a valid donation recipient.</seg>
<seg id="14">The three officers listed on Shield of Hope's state nonprofit records, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, did not immediately respond to emails Sunday seeking more information about the fundraising efforts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Zoll is a public information officer for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a city council member for nearby Florissant, and Roorda a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nor was The Times able to immediately reach the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, a user called "Stand Up," who has raised $235,750 and who has not been officially certified as a verified recipient on the donation page.</seg>
<seg id="17">GoFundMe's spokeswoman vouched for the anonymous donor in a statement to The Times, however.</seg>
<seg id="18">In contrast to the other Wilson page and the donation page for Brown, little information has been given to donors about who is running the anonymous fundraising effort.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a message to visitors two weeks ago, the anonymous Wilson fundraiser page wrote that it was working with Shield of Hope to become a verified recipient.</seg>
<seg id="20">That has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fundraiser also gave out a pseudonymous Gmail account to users seeking more information, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="22">In its statement to The Times, GoFundMe's spokeswoman said the anonymously run donation page had also been removed from its search results, adding that "this campaign no longer meets GoFundMe's stated requirement of having a valid Facebook account connected."</seg>
<seg id="23">GoFundMe's security policies encourage users to "only contribute payments to GoFundMe users they personally know and trust.</seg>
<seg id="24">Unfortunately there is no way to 100% guarantee that a user's GoFundMe donation page contains accurate or truthful information.</seg>
<seg id="25">But spokeswoman Little said GoFundMe "has been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to question their authenticity.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally, GoFundMe does possess the ability to place a hold on all donations raised by any campaign that warrants further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27">Nevertheless, she said GoFundMe did not place the hold.</seg>
<seg id="28">A popular Facebook page that has been organizing pro-Wilson efforts, called "Support Officer Wilson," told followers this weekend that lawyers were working on a "solution" as to why the GoFundMe fundraisers had been shut down, but gave no more information.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Facebook page is also run anonymously, and those remarks could not be independently verified.</seg>
